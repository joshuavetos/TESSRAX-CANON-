FACTS QUARANTINE

What lives here
Claims that appear factual but still require verification.

Examples
   •   Numbers
   •   Dates
   •   Quotes
   •   Attributions
   •   “X costs Y”
   •   “Law says Z”

Rules
   •   No interpretation
   •   No conclusions
   •   No synthesis
   •   Verification only

Outcome paths
   •   VERIFIED → may feed CLAIMS or CANON
   •   FALSE → moved to KILLED with reason
   •   UNVERIFIABLE → remains or is killed

Facts do not become Canon by themselves.
They only support Claims.
