RAW INTAKE DROP ZONE

Purpose
This file is a zero-friction capture surface.
It exists so Josh can paste raw information from a phone with no sorting, no thinking, no formatting.

Rules
	1.	Paste anything below this line.
	2.	Do NOT edit earlier entries.
	3.	One entry per block.
	4.	Separation is done by a single line containing ---.
	5.	No attempt should be made to decide importance here.
	6.	This file is allowed to be noisy, wrong, emotional, incomplete, or contradictory.

What belongs here
   •   Ideas
   •   Facts
   •   Claims
   •   Screenshots transcribed as text
   •   URLs
   •   Numbers
   •   Anger
   •   Observations
   •   Half-thoughts
   •   “This might matter” data

What does NOT happen here
   •   No canon decisions
   •   No summarization
   •   No cleanup
   •   No deletion
   •   No validation

Processing Model (important)
This file is never edited by automation.
Automation only READS this file.

External processes may:
   •   Extract entries into immutable blobs
   •   Kill entries that fail falsifiability
   •   Move survivors into QUARANTINE
   •   Produce diagnostics and receipts

But this file itself is sacred as a raw log.
