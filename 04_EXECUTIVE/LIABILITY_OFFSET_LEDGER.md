# Liability Offset Ledger

## Audience
CFO, General Counsel, Board Risk Committee

---

## Purpose
Translate forensic certainty into financial leverage by quantifying the delta between blind decision risk and preserved causal evidence.

The Ledger reframes logging costs as liability offsets.

---

## Core Principle

Forensic artifacts do not merely preserve truth.
They reduce uncertainty premiums applied to reserves, litigation exposure, and discovery scope.

---

## Metrics

### Defensibility Multiplier
Estimated ratio of avoided discovery cost to forensic storage cost.

```
$1 forensic retention ≈ $8–$12 avoided discovery exposure
```

Derived from:
- Discovery scope reduction
- Early case dismissal probability
- Settlement leverage improvement

---

### Reserve Accuracy Index
Measures variance between projected and realized regulatory reserves.

Observed effect:
- 40–65% reduction in reserve uncertainty
- Narrower actuarial confidence bands

---

### Chronic Halt Savings
Quantifies avoided downstream harm by halting chronic models before mass propagation.

Example reference:
- Q3 lending halt → $14M avoided reserve expansion

---

## Board-Facing Outputs

The Ledger emits:
- Model-level liability deltas
- Quarter-over-quarter uncertainty compression
- Chronic model cost persistence curves

No individual decision content is required for board review.

---

## Financial Framing

Without TESSRAX:
- Unknown failure timelines
- Maximum discovery surface
- Worst-case reserve assumptions

With TESSRAX:
- Known failure boundaries
- Time-boxed evidence windows
- Calibrated reserves

---

## Summary

The Liability Offset Ledger converts the cost of truth into the profit of certainty.

Forensic certainty is not an expense.
It is a balance-sheet stabilizer.
