# Adoption Roadmap: The 3-Stage Plug-In

## Objective
Enable phased adoption of TESSRAX with measurable value at each stage before enforcement.

No stage requires prior commitment to the next.

---

## Stage 1 — Observation (30 Days)

**Mode:** PASS-THROUGH  
**Impact:** Zero

Actions:
- Deploy Supervisory Sidecar in bypass mode
- Observe intervention rates
- Identify repeat offenders (>10%)

Outputs:
- Exception volume baselines
- No halts
- No retention changes

Value:
- Visibility without risk
- Early ROI signal

---

## Stage 2 — Evidentiary Pinning (60 Days)

**Mode:** CONDITIONAL  
**Impact:** Low

Actions:
- Enable 60-second buffers for first-breach models
- Activate EVIDENTIARY retention (180 days)
- Align Appendix C with existing schedules

Outputs:
- First causal artifacts
- Appeal reversibility signals

Value:
- Proof without shutdown
- Legal defensibility gain

---

## Stage 3 — Hard Enforcement (90 Days)

**Mode:** ENFORCED  
**Impact:** Targeted

Actions:
- Enforce CHRONIC halt rule
- Activate Rehabilitation Protocol
- Bind reserves to known states

Outputs:
- Decision Engine Halt for chronic models
- Board-visible liability offsets

Value:
- Risk ceiling established
- Governance made real

---

## Exit Guarantees

- Any stage may be paused without rollback
- No retroactive deletion permitted
- Prior artifacts remain immutable

---

## Summary

The roadmap ensures:
- Early value
- Controlled escalation
- No surprise enforcement

TESSRAX proves itself before it governs.
