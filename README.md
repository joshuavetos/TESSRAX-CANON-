# TESSRAX

TESSRAX is a governance and safety research repository focused on **epistemic integrity**, **fail-closed systems**, and **human reconstructability under failure**.

This repo exists to prevent:
- Narrative maintenance masquerading as governance
- Automation-induced atrophy of truth
- Systems that cannot be halted, audited, or reconstructed by humans

## Core Principles
- Truth must be reconstructable by humans using offline artifacts
- Any system that cannot survive interruption is already failed
- Silence, refusal, and HALT are valid success states
- Governance is meaningless without enforceable refusal
- **All non-trivial claims incur liability and must produce evidence**

Operational Scope (Clarification)

This repository contains both research artifacts and live governance mechanisms.

Where a domain is canonized as closed-world, the repository does not speculate, persuade, or explore alternatives. It defines:
   •   the admissible surfaces,
   •   the governing invariants,
   •   and the executable schemas that enforce them.

Applied systems in this repo (e.g., claimant-addressable liability discovery) are governed by the same fail-closed rules as the research itself. If a mechanism cannot be made deterministic, auditable, and haltable, it is excluded rather than approximated.

## Claim Economy
This repository operates under a **Claim Economy**:

- Speech creates obligations
- Claims must be falsifiable
- Failed claims reduce capability
- Unproven claims cannot be canonized
- Evidence is mandatory for adjudication

Language without liability is treated as a system failure.

## Repo Structure
- `/01_CANON/` — binding invariants and laws (non-derivable)
- `/02_PROTOCOLS/` — executable governance mechanisms
- `/03_DIAGNOSTICS/` — tests, audits, schemas, and receipts that expose failure
- `/04_CASES/` — applied analyses and adversarial examples
- `/05_LOGS/` — append-only ledgers and forensic records

## Output Philosophy
This repository does not optimize for readability, persuasion, or completeness.

It optimizes for:
- Auditability
- Reproducibility
- Failure visibility

If this repo becomes unreadable on paper, it has failed.
If a claim cannot be proven with artifacts in this repo, it is not true here.
