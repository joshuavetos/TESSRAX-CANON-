# TESSRAX

TESSRAX is a governance and safety research repository focused on **epistemic integrity**, **fail-closed systems**, and **human reconstructability under failure**.

This repo exists to prevent:
- Narrative Maintenance masquerading as governance
- Automation-induced Atrophy of Truth
- Systems that cannot be halted, audited, or reconstructed by humans

## Core Principles
- Truth must be reconstructable by humans using offline artifacts
- Any system that cannot survive interruption is already failed
- Silence, refusal, and HALT are valid success states
- Governance is meaningless without enforceable refusal

## Repo Structure
- `/01_CANON/` — binding invariants and laws
- `/02_PROTOCOLS/` — executable governance mechanisms
- `/03_DIAGNOSTICS/` — tests that reveal epistemic failure
- `/04_CASES/` — applied analyses
- `/05_LOGS/` — ledgers, receipts, forensic artifacts

If this repo becomes unreadable on paper, it has failed.
