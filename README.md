TESSRAX is a governance and safety research repository focused on **epistemic integrity**, **fail-closed systems**, and **human reconstructability under failure**.

This repository exists to prevent:

- Narrative maintenance masquerading as governance  
- Automation-induced atrophy of truth  
- Systems that cannot be halted, audited, or reconstructed by humans  

This is not a speculative or persuasive project.  
It is an enforcement-first repository.

---

## Core Invariants

TESSRAX operates under the following non-negotiable invariants:

- Truth must be reconstructable by humans using offline artifacts  
- Any system that cannot survive interruption is already failed  
- Silence, refusal, and HALT are valid success states  
- Governance without enforceable refusal is meaningless  
- **All non-trivial claims incur liability and must produce evidence**

If an invariant cannot be enforced mechanically, it is not admitted.

---

## Operational Scope

This repository contains **both research artifacts and live governance mechanisms**.

Where a domain is canonized as closed-world, the repository does not:
- speculate  
- persuade  
- optimize outcomes  
- explore alternatives  

It defines only:
- admissible execution surfaces  
- governing invariants  
- executable schemas that enforce them  

Applied systems in this repository (including claimant-addressable liability discovery mechanisms) are governed by the same fail-closed rules as the research itself.

If a mechanism cannot be made:
- deterministic  
- auditable  
- haltable  

it is excluded rather than approximated.

---

## Claim Economy

This repository operates under a strict **Claim Economy**:

- Speech creates obligations  
- Claims must be falsifiable  
- Failed claims reduce capability  
- Unproven claims cannot be canonized  
- Evidence is mandatory for adjudication  

Language without liability is treated as a system failure.

## Repository Structure

This repository is intentionally structured and numbered.  
Numbering reflects authority, not chronology.

- `00_README/` — identity, entrypoints, and framing artifacts  
- `01_CANON/` — binding invariants and laws (non-derivable)  
- `02_PROTOCOLS/` — executable governance mechanisms  
- `03_DIAGNOSTICS/` — tests, audits, schemas, and receipts that expose failure  
- `04_CASES/` — applied analyses and adversarial examples  
- `05_LOGS/` — append-only ledgers and forensic records  

Folders outside this structure are considered non-authoritative unless explicitly canonized.

---

## Execution Philosophy

This repository does not optimize for:
- readability  
- persuasion  
- onboarding  
- completeness  

It optimizes for:
- auditability  
- reproducibility  
- failure visibility  

If this repository becomes unreadable on paper, it has failed.  
If a claim cannot be proven using artifacts contained here, it is not true here.

---

## Authority

Where executable code, schemas, diagnostics, and contracts exist, they override prose.

If documentation and enforcement disagree:
- enforcement governs  
- documentation must be updated or treated as invalid
All enforcement logic is provided AS-IS, without warranty or implied fitness.
