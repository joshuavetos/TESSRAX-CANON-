PROJECT: NULL INTERFACE
AUTHORITY LEVEL: 01_CANON

==================================================
CORE IDENTIFIERS
==================================================

Title: NULL INTERFACE

Genre: Horror (Reactionless / Infrastructural)

Format: Limited Series or Feature (Geometry holds for either)

Premise Class: Reactionless Horror / Semantic Failure Horror

Primary Inversion:
Horror derives power from reaction.
This system removes reaction as an available interface.

==================================================
CORE THESIS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
==================================================

NULL INTERFACE is not a story about courage, wit, enlightenment, or resilience.

It is a story about functional depletion.

The protagonist does not resist the supernatural.
They do not process it.
They do not grow.

They continue.

The horror fails not because it is weak,
but because there is nothing left to extract.

==================================================
PROTAGONIST DEFINITION
==================================================

Name: Elara
Age: 30s
Condition: Functionally exhausted, emotionally depleted

NOT:
- Stoic
- Snarky
- Enlightened
- Genre-aware
- Defiant
- “Cool”

IS:
- Schedule-bound
- Resource-constrained
- Affect-flat
- Task-prioritized
- Physically tired

Key Principle:
Elara does not deny the supernatural.
She ranks it below rent, sleep, time, and penalties.

==================================================
INVARIANTS (LOCKED LAWS)
==================================================

INV-7 — Affective Zero
- No relief
- No sarcasm
- No triumph
- No fear payoff

INV-8 — Functional Priority
- Material consequences outweigh cosmic truth
- Bureaucratic reality outranks metaphysical revelation

INV-9 — Absence of Awe
- Revelations are treated like software updates:
  technically notable, practically irrelevant

==================================================
ANTAGONIST DEFINITION
==================================================

Nature:
Ancient, competent, powerful supernatural entity
designed to extract meaning through fear.

Core Failure:
Its existence requires recognition.

It does not want to kill.
It wants to matter.

When fear is not produced, the entity experiences semantic collapse.

==================================================
THE GEOMETRY OF HORROR
==================================================

Traditional Horror:
- Threat escalates
- Psyche fractures
- Fear validates antagonist
- Meaning extracted

NULL INTERFACE:
- Threat escalates
- Psyche remains inert
- Fear never produced
- Meaning extraction fails

Horror becomes procedural friction, not emotional collapse.

==================================================
ANTAGONIST ESCALATION LADDER
==================================================

LEVEL 01 — Semantic Terror
Intent: Awe / Dread
Manifestation: Blood on walls, whispers, symbols
Response: Cleaning, ignoring
Result: Failure

LEVEL 02 — Isolation
Intent: Cut off support
Manifestation: Locked doors, dead phones
Response: Mechanical solutions
Result: Failure

LEVEL 03 — Deprivation
Intent: Remove comfort
Manifestation: Spoiled food, no hot water, power loss
Response: Adaptation (crackers, camping stove)
Result: Pivot point

LEVEL 04 — Temporal Theft
Intent: Attack time
Manifestation: Time loops, distorted commute
Response: Walking, alarms, pay cut
Result: Physical degradation

LEVEL 05 — Direct Burden
Intent: Occupy space
Manifestation: 400lb physical mass blocking doorway
Response: Sleeping elsewhere, calling junk removal
Result: Stalemate

==================================================
PRODUCTION LAW: ANTI-SATIRE GUARDRAILS
==================================================

ABSOLUTE BANS:
- No comedy framing
- No musical stings
- No punchlines
- No reaction shots
- No “cool” horror imagery

If a shot looks impressive, it is wrong.
If a moment invites awe, it is wrong.

==================================================
CAMERA & VISUAL PHILOSOPHY
==================================================

Camera:
- Static or minimally motivated
- Observational, not expressive
- No push-ins for importance

Lighting:
- Practical only
- Fluorescent, sodium vapor, appliance light
- Supernatural does not bring its own light

Effects:
- Must look unfinished or malfunctioning
- Geometry misaligned
- Motion stuttering
- Texture unresolved

==================================================
SOUND DESIGN LAW
==================================================

Sound = Structural Pressure

Allowed:
- HVAC strain
- Pipe knock
- Electrical buzz
- Low-frequency interference

Forbidden:
- Musical cues
- Crescendos
- Emotional guidance

Silence is valid.
Silence is often correct.

==================================================
COLD OPEN (PROOF OF CONCEPT)
==================================================

11:00 PM.
Elara prepares a meal kit.

The refrigerator shrieks.
Lights fail.
A hulking non-Euclidean entity occupies the sink.

Elara sets the microwave.

Entity announces the end of reality.
Elara states she has to be up at 5:30.

She retrieves her food through the entity.
Eats.

The entity flickers, losing definition.

Cut to black.
No sting.

==================================================
KEY SCENES (SECOND ACT)
==================================================

THE LAUNDRY CYCLE
Void-soaked clothes.
Elara wrings out a work shirt by hand.
Shivering.
Entity watches.

THE COMMUTE
Bus arrives as an infinite screaming corridor.
Elara checks her watch.
Walks instead.
Puts in earplugs.
The bus follows, uselessly.

THE SINK
Black fluid floods the sink.
Elara bails it with a bucket for minutes.
The horror is the labor.

==================================================
TERMINAL STATE — B: THE INTEGRATION
==================================================

The entity is no longer a threat.
It is downgraded to a permanent, unfixable nuisance.

It causes leaks.
Interrupts utilities.
Never escalates meaningfully again.

Elara adapts.
Not triumphantly.
Practically.

The entity remains.
Obsolete.
Persistent.
Unacknowledged.

Final condition:
The horror is absorbed into the background cost of living.

==================================================
END STATES (ONLY PERMITTED)
==================================================

Terminal A — The Fade
Elara completes a mundane cycle and stops.
The entity remains, screaming into irrelevance.

Terminal B — The Integration (Canonical)
The horror becomes unresolved maintenance.

==================================================
FINAL THESIS (LOCKED)
==================================================

Some evils are not banished.
They are added to the list of things no one has time to fix.

==================================================
CLOSURE STATUS
==================================================

No catharsis.
No victory.
No explanation.
No restoration.

World state is worse, but familiar.

END OF CANON
