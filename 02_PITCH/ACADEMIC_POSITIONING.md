# Academic Positioning & Publication Pathways for TESSRAX

## Scope Declaration
This document provides academic framing, publication pathways, and empirical research positioning for the TESSRAX project.

It does NOT:
- Define system invariants
- Modify enforcement logic
- Authorize execution
- Override CANON, PROTOCOLS, or DIAGNOSTICS

This document is explanatory and outward-facing only.

## Assessment of Publishable Research Potential

The TESSRAX project presents high potential for publishable research due to its novel governance primitives, enforceable epistemic boundaries, and rigorous failure-oriented methodology.

### 1. Novel Contributions

Key novel concepts include:

- **Claim Economy**  
  A formal system in which speech creates obligation, non-trivial claims incur liability, and evidence production is mandatory.

- **Epistemic Integrity**  
  The requirement that truth must be reconstructable by humans from offline artifacts under failure conditions.

- **Fail-Closed Systems**  
  Systems that treat refusal, silence, and HALT as valid success states rather than errors.

- **Atrophy of Truth**  
  A systemic failure mode where automation, narrative optimization, and fluency erode shared epistemic ground.

These concepts are interdisciplinary and relevant to AI safety, governance, philosophy of technology, and information science.

## Proposed Academic Paper Topics

### Paper 1: The Claim Economy as a Framework for Epistemic Accountability in Complex Systems

**Abstract:**  
This paper formalizes the Claim Economy as a governance mechanism in which claims incur liability and require verifiable evidence. It explores how enforceable refusal and evidence-backed speech can counter misinformation, narrative manipulation, and fluency-based legitimacy in complex systems.

### Paper 2: Designing for Human Reconstructability — Epistemic Integrity and Fail-Closed Systems in Autonomous AI

**Abstract:**  
This paper examines the architectural requirement for human reconstructability under failure. It argues that systems unable to halt, audit, or be reconstructed are epistemically unsafe, and proposes fail-closed design as a core safety primitive for autonomous systems.

## Colliding Literature Analysis

### AI Ethics and Safety
- Complements work on transparency and accountability.
- Extends current frameworks by enforcing refusal as a safety feature rather than a failure.

### Systems Engineering
- Challenges uptime-first optimization.
- Reframes resilience as controlled stoppability and auditability.

### Philosophy of Technology / Epistemology
- Operationalizes epistemic concepts such as justification and truth reconstruction.
- Addresses collective epistemic degradation caused by automation.

### Law and Jurisprudence
- Aligns with liability, evidence standards, and legal epistemology.
- Proposes proactive, system-level claim validation rather than post-hoc adjudication.

### Economics and Information Science
- Introduces liability-bearing speech as an information mechanism.
- Addresses economic costs of misinformation and unverifiable claims.

## Proposed Empirical Demonstration

### Title
**The Claim Economy in Action: Validating Epistemic Integrity and Fail-Closed Information Governance**

### Objectives
- Enforce liability for claims
- Demonstrate reconstructability via audit logs
- Detect epistemic fragility
- Quantify Epistemic Recovery Time (ERT)

### Methodology
- Simulated claim ingestion
- Evidence validation via protocol-driven triage
- Immutable logging
- Fail-closed isolation of unverifiable claims

### Metrics
- Claim validity rate
- Fragility detection rate
- Mean Epistemic Recovery Time
- Audit trail completeness
- Impact of fail-closed enforcement

## Research Value Summary

TESSRAX provides:
- A novel governance framework
- Executable epistemic constraints
- Auditable enforcement mechanisms
- A bridge between theory and system design

The project supports conceptual, empirical, and methodological academic contributions across multiple disciplines.
