# Unified Governance Manifesto v1.0
## Hardware-Bound Kill Authority (HBKA) + Synthesis Licensing Protocol (SLP)

Status: LOCKED  
Authority Class: ENFORCEMENT (Non-Narrative)  
Scope: Frontier Compute + Synthetic Biology  
Principle: Governance is physical control or it is simulation.

---

## 0. Core Test (Binary, Non-Negotiable)

A system is GOVERNED iff it passes all three:

- **VETO** — An external authority can halt live execution.
- **PENALTY** — Violation causes non-reputational loss exceeding NPV of violation.
- **IRREVERSIBILITY** — Re-entry requires external re-licensing, time-lock, and capacity loss.

Failure of any ⇒ SIMULATION.

---

## 1. Invariant Set (Canonical)

### INV-VETO — Real-Time Stop
Live execution MUST be haltable by an external quorum within bounded time, independent of operator consent or state.

### INV-PENALTY — Economic Death
Violations MUST trigger physical or operational asset loss exceeding expected gains.

### INV-IRREVERSIBILITY — One-Way Door
No resume function exists. Re-activation requires:
- external quorum approval,
- mandatory cooldown,
- permanent capacity haircut,
- public forensic record.

---

## 2. Domain A — Frontier Compute (HBKA)

### 2.1 Chokepoint
**High-Speed Interconnect Fabric** (non-virtualizable).

### 2.2 Mechanism
- Hardware-bound accelerator identity.
- Scheduler-issued License Token (LT).
- Fabric-level gating + firmware HALT.
- Real-time telemetry (FLOPs/time).
- Revocation broadcasts (fail-closed).

### 2.3 Grid-Safe Revocation (GSR)
Tiered ramp-down curves prevent grid excursions while guaranteeing final DISABLED state.

### 2.4 Emergency Override (S4)
Re-admission is a **High-Cost Resuscitation**:
- minimum 14-day cooldown,
- automatic capacity haircut,
- permanent public ledger stain,
- insurance/rating downgrade.

### 2.5 Law Hooks
- Utility rulemaking (grid-critical load).
- Export controls on ungated interconnect.
- Insurance mandate for live stop authority.

**Classification:** CRITIQUE (Constraint)

---

## 3. Domain B — Synthetic Biology (SLP)

### 3.1 Chokepoint
**Controller ↔ Reagent Cartridge Handshake** (mutual binding).

### 3.2 Dual-Control Kernel (MV-SLP)
- Controller verifies machine license.
- Cartridge enforces chemistry release.
- Both require live external token.
- Telemetry at the edge (reagent units).

### 3.3 Automatic Quarantine
Mismatch or telemetry gap ⇒
- cartridge lock-out (chemical loss),
- machine quarantine,
- public ledger record.

### 3.4 Law Hooks
- Lab accreditation requirements.
- Cold-chain / courier verification.
- Insurance auto-void on bypass.

**Classification:** CRITIQUE (Constraint)

---

## 4. Public Falsification (Outsider Audit)

### 4.1 Transparency Logs
Append-only public status:
- ACTIVE / DISABLED
- timestamp
- quorum hash

### 4.2 Ambient Verification
- Power draw / thermal signatures (compute)
- Procurement vs. ledger consistency (bio)

**Rule:**  
If STATUS = DISABLED and ambient signal = ACTIVE ⇒ BYPASS CONFIRMED.

---

## 5. Rejected Mechanisms (Non-Binding)

Explicitly NON-GOVERNANCE:

- Voluntary pledges
- Advisory boards
- Transparency reports
- Open source licenses
- Carbon credits / offsets
- Screening lists without kill authority

These fail at least one binary invariant.

---

## 6. Compliance Checklist (Binary)

- [ ] Hardware identity non-forgeable?
- [ ] External quorum can halt live execution?
- [ ] Violation causes irreversible asset loss?
- [ ] Re-admission time-locked with haircut?
- [ ] Public falsification possible without privilege?

Any unchecked ⇒ FAIL.

---

## 7. Terminal Lock

This Manifesto defines the **minimum enforceable kernel** for governing liquid hazards.

Anything softer is simulation.  
Anything optional is extraction.  
Anything narrative is irrelevant.

END OF MANIFESTO.
