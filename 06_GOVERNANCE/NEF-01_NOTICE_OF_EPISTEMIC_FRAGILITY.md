# NEF-01 — Notice of Epistemic Fragility

## Purpose
To formally surface whether an institution owns its truth
or merely operates leased cognition.

## Declaration
The undersigned system owner affirms:

1. Humans can reconstruct system state from raw inputs offline.
2. This capability is trained, not theoretical.
3. This reconstruction has been exercised within the last 12 months.

## Failure
If any statement is false, the system is classified as:
Epistemically Fragile.

## Disclosure Effect
Filing this notice creates the institution’s first 1738 line:
formal admission of reconstruction failure.

## Use
Internal audit, whistleblower protection, regulator escalation.
