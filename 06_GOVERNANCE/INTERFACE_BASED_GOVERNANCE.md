# Interface-Based Governance

## Problem
Prescriptive law creates entanglement.
Systems become legally indispensable.

## Solution
Govern boundaries, not behavior.

## Principles
- Laws define interfaces
- Compliance = passing tests
- Intent is irrelevant

## Implications
- No vendor-specific mandates
- No proprietary compliance paths
- No narrative audits

## Enforcement
Regulator acts as CI server.
Failure triggers automatic consequence.

## Outcome
Systems are penalized for indispensability.
