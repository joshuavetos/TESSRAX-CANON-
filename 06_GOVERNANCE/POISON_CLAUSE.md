# The Poison Clause

## Definition
Every regulated system must have an automatic expiration.

## Structure
- Fixed sunset date
- Renewal requires modularity proof
- Failure revokes license by default

## Rationale
Anything that cannot be replaced is a liability.

## Effect
Prevents systems from becoming load-bearing law.

## Rule
If a system cannot be swapped, it cannot persist.
