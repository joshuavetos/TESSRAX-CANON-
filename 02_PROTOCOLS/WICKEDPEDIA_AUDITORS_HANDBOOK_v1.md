# WICKEDPEDIA — AUDITOR’S HANDBOOK (v1.0)

## PURPOSE
Prevent Wickedpedia from degrading into narrative, grievance, or opinion.
This protocol enforces a **Verify-Before-Narrate** invariant so every entry can survive adversarial review, legal challenge, and hostile scrutiny.

Wickedpedia is a **Forensic Database of Extraction**, not a moral forum.

---

## PRIMARY INVARIANT: THE RECEIPT

No claim exists without a receipt.
No receipt exists without a public, verifiable source.
Narrative is downstream of evidence, never upstream.

### A-TIER SOURCES (AUTOMATIC INCLUSION)
These sources are sufficient on their own:

- SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)
- Final court judgments (labor, environmental, fraud, antitrust)
- FOIA responses (infrastructure use, subsidies, contracts)
- Scientific or satellite data (environmental impact, patent lineage)
- Statutory enforcement records (fines, consent decrees)

### B-TIER SOURCES (DUAL-VERIFICATION REQUIRED)
These sources require corroboration by at least one A-Tier receipt:

- Investigative journalism with documented accuracy (e.g. ProPublica, ICIJ)
- Whistleblower disclosures verified via cryptographic provenance

If dual verification fails → **ENTRY BLOCKED**

---

## INDEXING PROTOCOL — CALCULATING EXTRACTION

Auditors must not use moral or emotional language.
All evaluation is computed using deterministic inputs.

### CORE QUESTION
What public systems does the entity depend on that are not symmetrically compensated?

### EXTRACTION SURFACES

#### 1. Infrastructure Debt
Invisible subsidies created by asymmetric use of public assets.

Example:
- $1B logistics usage on public roads
- $0 usage-specific taxation
→ Infrastructure Debt recorded

#### 2. Labor Externalization
Costs shifted from employer to state.

Example:
- Full-time workforce
- ≥20% reliant on SNAP, Medicaid, housing aid
→ Payroll externalization recorded

#### 3. Regulatory Capture
Disproportionate influence relative to outcomes.

Example:
- Lobbying spend vs regulatory enforcement delta
- Repeated exemptions, waived penalties, delayed enforcement

---

## FORENSIC STYLE GUIDE — NULL MOMENTUM

Tone must remain clinical, literal, and receipt-anchored.

### PROHIBITED
- “Greedy”
- “Corrupt”
- “Didn’t care”
- “Exploited”

### REQUIRED
- “The entity redirected $14M from the pension fund to executive bonuses, as documented in Receipt-04B.”
- “The entity was fined $2M for 47 instances of toxic runoff exceeding statutory limits by 400% (Receipt-09C).”

If tone drifts → **REWRITE REQUIRED**

---

## CONFLICT & CHALLENGE DOMAIN

Wickedpedia is **halt-on-error** by design.

### CONTRADICTION RULE
If two primary sources conflict:
- Entry status → `PENDING: CONTRADICTION DETECTED`
- No narrative permitted
- Resolution requires third-party authoritative source (court, FOIA)

### RIGHT TO CORRECT
Subjects may submit counter-receipts.

Rules:
- Must be A-Tier
- Index recalculates immediately
- History preserved (no deletion, only forward correction)

---

## AUDIT FAILURE FILTER (SFDD)

Every entry is checked against failure signatures:

- **F1 — Spec Drift**: Claim diverges from receipt
- **F3 — Oversight Illusion**: Individual credit for systemic output
- **F7 — Role Ambiguity**: Founder confused with system
- **F9 — Momentum Drift**: Narrative acceleration without new data

Any failure → **ENTRY HALTED**

---

## TERMINAL OUTPUT — WICKED SCORE CARD

All entries terminate in a machine-readable scorecard.

| Metric | Calculation | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Reciprocity Gap | (Public Input − Public Return) | Deficit / Balanced |
| Labor Externalization | Workforce state-aid reliance | Low / Medium / High |
| Infrastructure Debt | Unpriced public asset usage | Quantified |
| Systemic Capture | Lobbying vs enforcement delta | Present / Absent |

No composite “evil score.”
No moral ranking.
Only structural exposure.

---

## ENTRY STATES

- DRAFT — Receipts incomplete
- PENDING — Contradiction unresolved
- VERIFIED — All checks passed
- UPDATED — Counter-receipt applied

Deletion is not permitted.

---

## SCOPE LIMITATION

Wickedpedia does not:
- Infer intent
- Diagnose psychology
- Rank morality
- Predict future behavior

It discloses **structural facts only**.

---

## VERSIONING & IMMUTABILITY

- Protocol changes require version bump
- Prior versions remain valid for historical audits
- No silent modification permitted

---

## STATUS
PROTOCOL — ACTIVE  
Failure to comply invalidates the entry.
