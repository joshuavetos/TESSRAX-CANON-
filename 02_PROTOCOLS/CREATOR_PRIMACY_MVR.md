# Creator-Primacy Doctrine — Minimum Viable Rules (MVR)

Status: Operational Protocol  
Scope: Platform-agnostic (subreddits, Discords, private creative communities)  
Intent: Correct the Asymmetry of Risk between creators and extractors using minimal, enforceable mechanics.

---

## 1. WRITE-LOCK (THE BUILD)

**Rule**  
Once a creator marks a Project or Build as finalized, its primary state is write-locked.

**Definition**  
A “Finalized Build” is any post explicitly labeled by the creator as complete or versioned (e.g., Finished, Release, v1.0).

**Mechanic**  
- Casual users cannot edit, annotate, downvote, or devalue the core asset during the lock window.
- Reflective criticism is deferred, not banned.

**Rationale**  
Prevents reactive entropy and drive-by suppression while preserving the right to critique after reflection.

## 2. ASYMMETRIC BURDEN OF PROOF

**Rule**  
The burden of clarification lies on the Challenger, not the Creator.

**Mechanic**  
To register a negative signal (report, dismissal, or devaluing label), the challenger must complete a forensic template:

> “I am flagging **[specific artifact]** because it violates **[explicit rule or failure mode]**.”

**Enforcement**  
- Low-resolution labels (e.g., “slop,” “trash,” “garbage”) are auto-rejected.
- Incomplete templates are silently dropped.
- Clarifying questions and neutral observations are exempt.

**Rationale**  
Eliminates ambiguity attacks and forces specificity without adjudicating taste or intent.

## 3. LATENCY-LOCKED CRITIQUE

**Rule**  
Friction is a feature.

**Mechanic**  
Negative signaling tools are only available after a minimum verified engagement threshold (60–120 seconds).

**Enforcement**  
- Signals issued before threshold visibility are ignored.
- No retroactive credit is given.

**Rationale**  
Destroys the high-leverage, zero-effort advantage of extractors while remaining fair to good-faith critics.

---

## 4. DELAYED SIGNAL PROPAGATION

**Rule**  
Prevent the swarm.

**Mechanic**  
Negative signals are batched and released to the creator at fixed intervals (e.g., once every 24 hours).

**Enforcement**  
- No real-time dogpiling.
- Moderation review occurs before release if forensic compliance is in question.

**Rationale**  
Protects creator focus, prevents engagement drain, and collapses mob amplification dynamics.

## COMPARATIVE OUTCOME

| Dimension | Legacy Engagement Platforms | Creator-Primacy Protocol |
|---------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Downvote Cost | 0 ms / 0 effort | Time + Forensic Template |
| Critique Resolution | Ambiguous labels | Specific failure claims |
| Visibility Dynamics | Viral dogpiling | Sequential, batched review |
| Incentive Alignment | Extraction | Construction |

## TERMINAL PRINCIPLE

Creation must be harder to destroy than to dismiss.

This protocol enforces that principle without identity checks, tokens, reputation systems, or discretionary moderation.
