# MODE HEADER RULE

Authority: PROTOCOL  
Status: ACTIVE  
Purpose: Prevent research/enforcement ambiguity.

## Rule
Every document, artifact, or pipeline MUST declare exactly one header:

- MODE: RESEARCH (NON-ENFORCING)
- MODE: ENFORCEMENT (CANON-BOUND)

## Constraints
- No hybrid modes
- No implied promotion
- Absence of header = INVALID

## Promotion Ceremony
Transition from RESEARCH to ENFORCEMENT requires:
- Explicit promotion event
- Diff of material changes
- Justification for enforcement

## Failure Mode Prevented
Accidental canonization through ambiguity.
