# Kill-Switch Stress Test

## Definition
A **Kill-Switch Stress Test** is a forced hypothetical removal of a single dependency node to measure systemic collapse, contagion, and resilience.

The test evaluates *loss tolerance*, not growth potential.

## Procedure
1. Select one dependency node (supplier, protocol, jurisdiction, system).
2. Assume immediate and total loss of that node.
3. Trace first-order and second-order effects.
4. Record which functions fail, degrade, or adapt.

## Output
- **Collapse Delta:** magnitude of functional loss
- **Propagation Path:** how failure spreads
- **Recovery Feasibility:** whether reconstruction is possible without the node

## Invariant
Systems optimized for efficiency without redundancy exhibit non-linear collapse under node removal.

## Purpose
- Identify hidden single points of failure.
- Distinguish robustness from apparent scale.
- Test claims of resilience without relying on incident history.

## Constraints
This is a structural test, not a prediction.  
Results are comparative and scenario-bound.
