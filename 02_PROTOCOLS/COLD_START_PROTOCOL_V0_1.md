# TESSRAX Cold-Start Protocol v0.1

## Objective
Enable reconstruction of institutional truth by humans after total digital loss.

Truth must survive system death.

## Constraint
Five tired humans.
No power.
Paper logs only.

## Core Principle
Log causality, not data.

## Required Artifact
Human-Readable Ledger of Intent (HRLI)

Each action must emit a receipt answering:
- Who acted?
- Under what authority?
- Based on what evidence?
- Which gate changed?
- What risk moved?

## Failure Condition
If humans cannot redraw the system’s causal arc from logs alone,
the system is epistemically unsafe.

## Verification
48-hour offline forensic replay.
Success requires >99% consensus on state.

## Status
MANDATORY for any system claiming safety or governance.
