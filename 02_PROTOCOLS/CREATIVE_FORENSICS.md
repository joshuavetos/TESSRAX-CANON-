Truth-Anchor Protocol (TAP)
Purpose: Prevent narrative distortion in creative artifacts by enforcing invariant-first generation.

Rules
	1.	Identify a single system invariant that persists under self-deception.
	2.	Reject any concept that relies on metaphor, inspiration, or affect without causal grounding.
	3.	Represent the system after success, at the point where cost is already paid.
	4.	If the artifact feels reassuring, marketable, or aspirational → INVALID.
	5.	Stop when the image or sentence induces discomfort proportional to the invariant.

Failure Mode
If no invariant can be identified, generation must halt.
