# NEF-01 — NOTICE OF EPISTEMIC FRAGILITY

## Purpose
To formally document whether an institution
can reconstruct its own truth without digital systems.

## Declaration
This notice asserts that operational continuity
does not imply epistemic integrity.

## Required Response (Binary)

1. Can five employees reconstruct authoritative state
   using only printed logs and offline tools within 24 hours?

YES / NO

## If NO
This constitutes:
- Admission of epistemic dependency
- Identification of ESPF
- Generation of a “1738 Line”

## Required Follow-Up
- Document ERT
- Identify reconstruction blockers
- Schedule failure drill

## Legal Note
Failure to respond accurately may constitute
material misrepresentation of operational resilience.
