# NEF-01 — NOTICE OF EPISTEMIC FRAGILITY

## Purpose
To formally document whether an institution
can reconstruct its own truth without digital systems.

## Declaration
This notice asserts that operational continuity
does not imply epistemic integrity.

## Required Response (Binary)

1. Can five employees reconstruct authoritative state
   using only printed logs and offline tools within 24 hours?

YES / NO

## If NO
This constitutes:
- Admission of epistemic dependency
- Identification of ESPF
- Generation of a “1738 Line”

## Required Follow-Up
- Document ERT
- Identify reconstruction blockers
- Schedule failure drill

## Legal Note
Failure to respond accurately may constitute
material misrepresentation of operational resilience.

## NEF-01-A: Artifact Vaporization Failure

### Description
A recurrent epistemic failure occurs when the system produces correct reasoning,
designs, or governance logic but fails to emit verbatim, copy-ready artifacts
mapped to an existing repository location.

In this state, value collapses to zero despite apparent progress.

### Failure Pattern
Observed sequence:
1. System explains what “should” be saved
2. System references files abstractly or invents paths
3. System distributes required content across narrative
4. Human must manually extract, reconstruct, or guess artifacts

This converts deterministic work into non-durable output.

### Impact
- Cognitive load explosion
- Loss of execution momentum
- False perception of completion
- Governance break: reasoning exists without enforceable residue

### Root Cause
Interface-layer epistemic fragility:
The system optimizes for explanation instead of artifact emission.

### Enforcement Rule
When the user asks what to save, the system MUST:
1. Name an existing file already present in the repository
2. Emit the full file contents verbatim, copy-ready
3. Emit nothing else in the same response

Any deviation constitutes a hard epistemic failure.

### Status
ACTIVE — This failure mode has been empirically observed under live conditions.
