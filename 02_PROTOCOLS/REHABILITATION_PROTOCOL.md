# Supervised Rehabilitation Protocol

## Objective
Provide a lawful, evidence-based exit from the CHRONIC state while preserving full forensic integrity.

## Scope
Rehabilitation is bound to a specific `model_id + model_version_hash`.
Legacy versions remain CHRONIC indefinitely.

## Rehabilitation Gates
A CHRONIC model may transition to EVIDENTIARY only upon satisfaction of all gates:

1. Zero-Breach Window  
   12 consecutive months with intervention rate <10% across all cohorts.

2. External Validation  
   Independent auditor certifies the `model_version_hash` resolves the documented failure mode.

3. Causal Resolution  
   Appeal win rate exceeds 90% on retained CHRONIC artifacts.

4. Board Certification  
   Risk Committee minutes document “Rehabilitation Complete”.

## Invariants
- Prior CHRONIC artifacts remain Category 1 (indefinite).
- No rehabilitation without survival of full forensic history.
- Self-healing without external validation is prohibited.
