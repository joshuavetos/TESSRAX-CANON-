# Broker Script — Do Not Improvise

OPENING
“This is for sellers uncomfortable with PE who don’t know alternatives exist.
It’s not anti-PE.”

SETUP
“Some sellers can’t give PE what it needs.
Those deals die slow and waste your time.”

OFFER
“The Clean Exit places the company in a permanent trust.
Seller keeps uncapped income.
No earnout. No integration. Legacy protected.”

BROKER BENEFIT
“Your fee is safer. 100% cash at close. Faster cycle.”

OBJECTION — PE RELATIONSHIPS
“This is for sellers who were never going to close with PE anyway.”

OBJECTION — LIQUIDITY
“Not all sellers want a lump sum. This filters them.”

ASK
“Run the diagnostic with one seller. If they score high, we talk.”
