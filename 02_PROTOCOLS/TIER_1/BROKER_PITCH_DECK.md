# The Clean Exit Alternative
A structured succession path that protects seller legacy, accelerates close, and removes PE litigation risk

## Slide 1 — Title
This is for sellers who want speed and certainty but are uncomfortable with Private Equity.
It is not anti-PE. It is a different tool for a different seller.

## Slide 2 — The Problem Brokers Already See
• Sellers hesitate at LOI because they don’t trust PE  
• Earnouts create 18-month exposure and frequent litigation  
• Workers/community create post-close reputation risk  

## Slide 3 — What PE Requires
• Full asset control  
• Unrestricted exit rights  
• Margin extraction  

Some sellers cannot give these without moral or reputational injury.

## Slide 4 — The Clean Exit
• Permanent Steward Trust  
• Seller retains uncapped dividend income  
• Trust vetoes future sale  
• Workers remain, management unchanged  
• No PE, no earnout, no post-close risk  

## Slide 5 — Why This Closes Faster Than PE
PE: adversarial diligence, repricing, integration risk  
Clean Exit: confirmatory diligence, no integration, no earnout  

Typical close: 45–60 days.

## Slide 6 — Broker Fee Safety
• 100% cash at close  
• No earnout exposure  
• No clawback risk  
• Faster cycles = more annual closes  

## Slide 7 — Ideal Seller Profile
• Age 55–70  
• Profitable ($1M+ EBITDA)  
• Strong local identity  
• Has other assets  
• Uncomfortable with PE
