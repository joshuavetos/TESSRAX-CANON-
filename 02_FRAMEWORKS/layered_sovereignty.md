# Layered Sovereignty

## Definition
**Layered Sovereignty** is the principle that an entity’s durable power is determined by which *dependency layers* it controls, not by surface metrics such as revenue, valuation, market share, or headcount.

Control of lower, more primitive layers dominates control of higher, derivative layers.

## Dependency Layers (abstract)
1. **Physical / Material** — raw materials, energy, fabrication capacity
2. **Manufacturing / Process** — tooling, yield, throughput, logistics
3. **Logical / Technical** — architectures, protocols, software primitives
4. **Standards / Interfaces** — APIs, formats, regulatory definitions
5. **Capital / Coordination** — financing, governance, contracts

## Invariant
Control at a lower layer constrains all higher layers.  
Loss of a lower layer cannot be compensated by dominance at higher layers.

## Test
For any entity:
1. Identify the lowest layer it meaningfully controls.
2. Hypothetically remove that layer.
3. Observe whether the entity retains operational power.

If power collapses, sovereignty resided at that layer.

## Purpose
- Replace narrative explanations of power with structural ones.
- Prevent mistaking financial success for infrastructural control.
- Enable cross-domain comparison of entities with different business models.

## Notes
Layered Sovereignty is descriptive, not moral.  
It explains *where power sits*, not whether it should.
