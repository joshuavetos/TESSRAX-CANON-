# Scope and Non-Scope

This repository contains working systems and exploratory designs.

Not everything here is production-ready.
Not everything here is real.

## What This Repo IS

- A collection of fail-closed, invariant-driven systems
- Demonstrations of statutory freshness enforcement
- Evidence that refusal can be safer than execution

## What This Repo IS NOT

- A solved AI alignment framework
- A global governance solution
- A claim of scalability beyond tested domains

## If You Are Looking For

- Operational code → see VK-01
- Governance theory → see DESIGN docs
- Proof of scale → it does not exist here

Misrepresentation of scope defeats the purpose of this work.
