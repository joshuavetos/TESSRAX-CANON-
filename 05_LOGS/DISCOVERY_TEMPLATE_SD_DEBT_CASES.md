TESSRAX DISCOVERY REQUEST TEMPLATE
Sioux Falls Debt Collection Cases — True Receipt vs. Reported Bill

CASE DESIGNATION
Predatory Stasis Audit — Debt Collection Cohort

JURISDICTION
U.S. District Court, District of South Dakota (Sioux Falls Division)

DEFENDANTS
Sanford Health System
UnitedHealth Group, Inc.
OptumRx, Inc.
Affiliated Subsidiaries and Collection Agents

TIMEFRAME
January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2025

AUDIT FRAME
INV-4 (Receipts > Reports)
F3 (Zombie Halt / Prior Authorization Limbo)
INV-M (Monotonicity Breach)

PURPOSE
This discovery request is designed to expose the delta between the True Receipt (actual net acquisition cost, including rebates and intercompany transfers) and the Reported Bill (patient-facing invoice and debt claim). The objective is to prove structural extraction, not billing error, by reconstructing ledger reality across delayed, denied, and litigated claims.

SECTION 2 — INTERROGATORIES (Rule 33)

Answer the following under oath:
	1.	For each sampled debt case, state:
a) True Receipt cost
b) Rebate or credit retained
c) Reported Bill amount
d) Percentage markup
	2.	Calculate the aggregate INV-4 delta (Reported Bill minus True Receipt) across the cohort.
	3.	Identify the average and median duration claims remained unpaid after coverage determination and compute the associated interest earned on retained funds.
	4.	State annual Community Benefit growth rates and Revenue growth rates for Sanford Health during the timeframe and reconcile any divergence.
	5.	Identify all intercompany transfers exceeding $1,000,000 related to PBM, insurer, or collection activity tied to these cases.

SECTION 3 — REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION (Rule 36)

Admit or deny the following:
	1.	True Receipt costs were less than 50 percent of the Reported Bill in a majority of debt cases.
	2.	Prior authorization delays generated material interest income on retained funds.
	3.	Community Benefit growth lagged Revenue growth during the audit period.
	4.	Debt collection activity increased while clinical staffing ratios degraded.

Failure to admit requires a detailed factual explanation.

SECTION 4 — ENFORCEMENT AND SANCTIONS

Failure to comply will be treated as evidence of spoliation and intentional opacity. Remedies sought include adverse inference instructions, compelled disclosure, referral to antitrust authorities, and structural remedies consistent with monopoly maintenance findings.
