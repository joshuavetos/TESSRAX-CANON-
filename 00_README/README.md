# TESSRAX-CANON

This repository is a **low-entropy body of truth**.

It exists to solve one problem:

> How do humans retain agency, reconstruct truth, and assign responsibility
> in systems where machines act faster than people can understand?

## What This Is
- A **canon**, not a brainstorm
- A **reconstruction-first** knowledge base
- A place where ideas must survive loss of power, tools, and context

## What This Is Not
- A note dump
- An AI alignment scrapbook
- A startup pitch
- A real-time journal

## Operating Principles
1. **Reconstructability over continuity**
2. **Fail-closed over plausible deniability**
3. **Humans must be able to re-derive truth by hand**
4. **If it can’t be explained on paper, it doesn’t exist**

## File Discipline
- Files in `01_CANON` are rare and hard to add.
- Protocols must be runnable by tired humans.
- Diagnostics must expose failure, not explain it away.
- Anything obsolete moves to `99_ARCHIVE`, never deleted.

## Authority
This repo is authoritative **only** where explicitly stated.
Silence means “unknown,” not “assumed false.”

If the screens go dark, this is what remains.
