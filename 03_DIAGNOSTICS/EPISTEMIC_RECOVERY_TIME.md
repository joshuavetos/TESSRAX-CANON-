# Diagnostic: Epistemic Recovery Time (ERT)

## Definition
ERT is the time required for humans to re-establish system truth
after total digital loss using only raw logs and basic tools.

## Distinction
- RTO: time to restore systems
- RPO: amount of data lost
- ERT: time to understand what is true

## Key Insight
A system can have:
- near-zero RTO
- zero RPO
- infinite ERT

## Implication
Low ERT = human sovereignty
High ERT = narrative dependence

## Rule
If ERT is not measured, it is assumed infinite.
