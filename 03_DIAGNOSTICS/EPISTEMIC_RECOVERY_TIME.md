# Diagnostic: Epistemic Recovery Time (ERT)

## Definition
Epistemic Recovery Time (ERT) is the time required for humans to re‑establish system truth after total digital loss using only raw logs and basic tools.

ERT measures **understanding**, not restoration.

## Distinction
- **RTO** — time to restore systems  
- **RPO** — amount of data lost  
- **ERT** — time to understand what is true  

These metrics are independent.

## Key Insight
A system may exhibit:
- near‑zero RTO  
- zero RPO  
- **infinite ERT**  

This is the signature of epistemic collapse.

## Implication
- **Low ERT → human sovereignty**  
- **High ERT → narrative dependence**  

ERT reveals who actually owns the truth.

## Rule
If ERT is not measured, it is assumed **infinite**.
