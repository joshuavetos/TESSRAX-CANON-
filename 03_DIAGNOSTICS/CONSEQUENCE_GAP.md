# CONSEQUENCE_GAP

## Definition
The Consequence Gap is the condition in which a system’s actions are decoupled from fast, local, and proportional corrective feedback.  
It emerges when errors do not immediately constrain future behavior, allowing confidence to grow without calibration.

## Detection Criteria (Observable Only)
- Repeated decisions proceed without operational stops despite prior errors.
- Penalties are delayed, symbolic, or absorbed by third parties.
- Risk-bearing actors do not experience material downside from failure.
- System output quality degrades without triggering halt conditions.
- Feedback arrives after outcomes are irreversible.

## Failure Modes
- Overconfidence without competence.
- Escalating risk tolerance.
- Sudden, non-linear collapse when external constraints reassert.
- Inability to adapt under changing conditions.
- Post-failure confusion (“this wasn’t supposed to happen”).

## Application Protocol
1. Identify the decision-maker.
2. Trace the shortest path from action to consequence.
3. Verify whether the decision-maker personally absorbs downside.
4. Measure feedback latency and reversibility.
5. If consequences are indirect, delayed, or non-binding, the gap exists.
