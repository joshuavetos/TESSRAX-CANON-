# Diagnostic: The 1738 Line

## Purpose
Identify the moment a system admits humans can no longer reconstruct truth manually.

## Definition
The 1738 Line is crossed when manual re-derivation of state fails and the system acknowledges it.

## Canonical Form
[AUDITOR] | RECON_TEST | REJECTED | +RISK

## Significance
Marks the transition from:
Governable → Narrative Maintenance

Once crossed, the institution no longer owns its truth; it only maintains stories about it.

## Observation
Most institutions never log this line.  
They suppress it by redefining success, expanding “acceptable variance,” or narrowing what counts as truth.

## Rule
If the line is missing, the failure is assumed present.
