# Epistemic Recovery Time (ERT)

## Definition
ERT is the time required for humans to reconstruct system truth using only raw logs and basic tools.

ERT measures:
- Human ownership of truth
- Degree of epistemic atrophy
- Severity of system entanglement

## Why It Matters
A system with low uptime but low ERT is recoverable.
A system with perfect uptime and infinite ERT is dead.

## Core Test
Provide raw event logs for a 24-hour period.

Question:
“Can humans determine the correct state by tomorrow morning without a computer?”

If no, the system is epistemically bankrupt.

## States

- Sovereign: Humans own truth
- Brittle: Humans can see truth dimly
- Pathological: System owns truth

ERT must be tracked like latency or error rate.
