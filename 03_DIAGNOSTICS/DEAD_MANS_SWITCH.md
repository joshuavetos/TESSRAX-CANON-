# Diagnostic: Dead Man’s Switch

## Question
What single task must humans perform manually if the system fails tomorrow to prevent collapse?

## Method
Ignore high-tech components.
Identify the most boring dependency.

Examples:
- Manual ledger reconciliation
- Inventory state reconstruction
- Patient status derivation
- Access revocation authority

## Failure Signal
“If the system is down, we wait.”

## Interpretation
If no human can perform the task offline:
- the switch is decorative
- the system is already terminal

## Note
A Dead Man’s Switch is not a lever.
It is trained memory.
