# DEAD MAN’S SWITCH DIAGNOSTIC

## Question
What must humans do by hand
if the system fails tomorrow?

## Instruction
Ignore “high-tech” answers.
Find the boring dependency.

## Indicators of Failure
- “We’ve never done that manually”
- “The system reconciles it for us”
- “That knowledge left with a vendor”

## Outcome
If the task cannot be performed,
the manual override is decorative.

## Note
The switch is memory.
Automation erases memory first.
