# Infrastructure Failure Map — 2026-01-06

## Forbidden Patterns
- Self-adjudication by model
- Pattern-match routing
- Destructive refactoring
- Live-file scanning
- Implicit trust via self-generated hashes
- Goal-less observation spending

## Required Fixes
- External enforcement boundary (CI / runtime)
- Immutable capture blobs
- Disqualification-based routing law
- External trust anchor (human-signed or protected branch)

## Principle
Automation must liquidate entropy, not create structure.
Structure is a human act.
