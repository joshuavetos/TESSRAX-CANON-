# KILL SPRINT — CAREER CONTEXT (SCOPED)

## Current Situation
Operating primarily within traditional employment and institutional-facing work, with diffuse responsibility, layered approvals, and delayed evaluation cycles.

## Consequence Gap Present?
YES.

### Evidence
- Performance evaluation decoupled from real-world impact.
- Errors absorbed by organization rather than individual.
- Success measured by compliance and optics rather than outcomes.
- Downside risk (time, reputation, income) capped regardless of miscalibration.

## Reality-Binding Feedback Loop Exists?
NO.

### Evidence
- No immediate halt on flawed assumptions.
- Feedback arrives as meetings, reviews, or narratives rather than hard constraints.
- External validation inconsistent and lagging.

## Actionable Decision
MODIFY.

Reduce exposure to environments with diffuse accountability.  
Increase allocation to work where errors halt progress immediately and artifacts must survive contact with reality (forensic tools, physical artifacts, receipt-bound systems).
