# NEF-01 — NOTICE OF EPISTEMIC FRAGILITY
## Formal Disclosure of Truth Reconstruction Failure

---

## Purpose

This notice formally records a failure of **Epistemic Sovereignty**.

It is issued when an institution can no longer
reconstruct the authoritative state of a system
without relying on live digital infrastructure.

This is not a performance issue.
This is a **truth ownership failure**.

---

## Trigger Conditions

Issue NEF-01 if **any** of the following are true:

- Humans cannot re-derive system state from raw logs
- Manual reconciliation exceeds 24 hours
- Knowledge required to operate the system is vendor-held
- “Availability” is used as a substitute for verification
- Contingency plans assume screens remain on

---

## Declaration

We hereby acknowledge that:

- The system remains operational
- The system is **not epistemically reconstructable**
- Human operators cannot independently verify truth
- Continuity is masking loss of authority

This constitutes **Epistemic Fragility**.

---

## Scope of Impact

Affected System(s): ________________________  
Subsystem(s): ______________________________  
Primary Truth Domain:
- [ ] Financial
- [ ] Medical
- [ ] Legal
- [ ] Identity
- [ ] Infrastructure
- [ ] Other: _______________________________

## Epistemic Failure Description

Describe, without narrative or justification:

- What cannot be reconstructed:
  _______________________________________
- Why humans cannot reconstruct it:
  _______________________________________
- What must remain “up” to preserve truth:
  _______________________________________

---

## Risk Statement

If the digital substrate fails:

- Truth cannot be proven
- Authority cannot be demonstrated
- Ownership cannot be verified
- Recovery depends on replacement machines

This is a **Sovereignty Risk**, not an outage.

---

## Mandatory Follow-Ups

Within 30 days:

- Run ERT-01 assessment
- Identify Epistemic Single Point of Failure (ESPF)
- Publish manual reconstruction plan
- Assign human accountability owner

Failure to complete follow-ups escalates to
**Pathological Entanglement** status.

## Sign-Off

Authorized By: ___________________________  
Role / Title: ____________________________  
Date: ___________________________________

## Final Assertion

If humans cannot explain the system,
the system owns the humans.

This notice records the moment that became true.
