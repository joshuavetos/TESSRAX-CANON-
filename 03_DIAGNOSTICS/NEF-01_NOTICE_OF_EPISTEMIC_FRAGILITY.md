# NEF-01 — NOTICE OF EPISTEMIC FRAGILITY
## Formal Declaration of Reconstructability Risk

---

## Purpose

This notice exists to force explicit acknowledgment of
**Epistemic Recovery Failure** within an institution.

It is not an accusation.
It is a diagnostic trigger.

If this document cannot be answered cleanly,
the institution has discovered its first 1738 line.

---

## Definition

**Epistemic Fragility** occurs when an institution can operate systems
but cannot reconstruct their truth manually.

Operational continuity without epistemic sovereignty
is a form of systemic misrepresentation.

---

## Mandatory Question (Non-Negotiable)

> If provided with a complete, printed log of all raw events
> for the last 24 hours, can human operators reconstruct
> the current authoritative state **without digital tools**?

Answer options:
- YES (demonstrated)
- NO (admitted)
- UNKNOWN (equivalent to NO)

Narratives are not accepted.

---

## Scope of Application

This notice applies to:
- Financial ledgers
- Health records
- Identity systems
- Supply chains
- Case management
- Safety enforcement systems

If humans cannot re-derive state,
the system is epistemically bankrupt.

---

## Required Institutional Response

Within 30 days, the institution must provide:

1. A named owner of Epistemic Recovery
2. A documented manual reconstruction procedure
3. A measured Epistemic Recovery Time (ERT)
4. Results of a live manual reconstruction drill

Failure to respond constitutes acknowledgment of fragility.

---

## Disallowed Responses

The following invalidate the response:
- “The system is too complex”
- “We rely on vendor guarantees”
- “This scenario is unrealistic”
- “Uptime is sufficient”

Complexity is not an exemption.
Vendors are not sovereigns.
Continuity is not truth.

---

## Classification Outcomes

| Result | Classification |
|---|---|
| Manual reconstruction < 8h | Sovereign |
| Manual reconstruction 8–24h | Brittle |
| Manual reconstruction impossible | Pathologically Entangled |

---

## Legal & Governance Implication

Once issued, NEF-01 becomes a **discoverable artifact**.
Non-response or evasion establishes willful epistemic blindness.

---

## Final Assertion

A system that cannot be understood by its operators
cannot be governed.

This notice exists to surface that fact
before catastrophe does it instead.

END NOTICE
