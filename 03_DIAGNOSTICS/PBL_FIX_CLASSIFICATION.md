# PHYSICAL BINDING LAYER (PBL) — FIX CLASSIFICATION

## Survivable Fixes
Characteristics:
- Fail fast.
- Fail visibly.
- Surface underlying problems early.

Examples:
- Tool-less braces that visibly slip under load.
- Systems that emit explicit halt states on uncertainty.
- Fixes that degrade before causing secondary damage.

## Provisional Fixes
Characteristics:
- Work only while the environment remains forgiving.
- Depend on stable conditions or low variance.
- Require monitoring to remain safe.

Examples:
- Cardboard shims.
- Temporary software workarounds without alerts.
- Informal process shortcuts.

## Dangerous Fixes
Characteristics:
- Hide drift.
- Delay consequences.
- Create false confidence.

Examples:
- Cosmetic reinforcements that mask structural failure.
- Manual overrides without audit trails.
- Systems that continue operating under ambiguous state.

## Retroactive Classification
- Cardboard appliance shims: PROVISIONAL.
- Formalized stabilization kit (SB-01): SURVIVABLE.
- Institutional assurances without binding stops: DANGEROUS.
