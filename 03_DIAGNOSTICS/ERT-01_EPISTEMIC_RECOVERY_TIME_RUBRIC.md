# ERT-01 — EPISTEMIC RECOVERY TIME (ERT) RUBRIC
## Manual Truth Reconstruction Assessment

---

## Purpose

This rubric measures whether humans still **own the truth**
of a system or merely operate its interface.

ERT is not about uptime.
ERT is about understanding.

---

## Test Definition

**Epistemic Recovery Time (ERT):**
The time required for human operators to reconstruct
the authoritative state of a system using only
offline artifacts.

No cloud tools.
No LLMs.
No production systems.

Paper, pens, calculators only.

Test ID: ERT-YYYYMMDD  
Target System: ____________________  
Raw Input Source: __________________  
Participants: _____________________  
Start Time: _______________________  
End Time: _________________________

## Scoring Rubric

| Criteria | 0 — Failure | 1 — Partial | 2 — Mastery |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tool Isolation | Used live systems | Used spreadsheets | Paper / mental math |
| Input Sufficiency | Logs incomplete | Logs required lookup | Logs self-contained |
| Causal Trace | “We think it’s X” | “X because of Y” | Full audit trail |
| Drift Tolerance | >5% disagreement | 1–5% disagreement | <1% disagreement |
| Time to Truth | >24h / aborted | 8–24h | <8h |

---

## Final Score

Total Score (0–10): _______

---

## Classification

| Score | Status |
|---|---|
| 8–10 | Sovereign (Humans own truth) |
| 4–7 | Brittle Dependency |
| 0–3 | Pathological Entanglement |

---

## Mandatory Disclosure

If score < 6, the institution is in a state of
**Semantic Fraud**.

The system presents certainty externally
that cannot be internally verified.

---

## Required Follow-Up (If < 6)

- Issue NEF-01
- Schedule quarterly manual drills
- Identify Epistemic Single Point of Failure
- Publish remediation timeline

---

## Prohibited Excuses

- “No one does this”
- “The system is too complex”
- “We have backups”
- “The data is safe”

Backups preserve data.
They do not preserve understanding.

---

## Final Assertion

A system that cannot be rebuilt by its operators
is already lost.

ERT makes that visible.
