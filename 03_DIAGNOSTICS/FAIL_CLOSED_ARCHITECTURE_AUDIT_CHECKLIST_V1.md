# Fail-Closed Architecture Audit (Checklist v1.0)

Status: WRITE-LOCKED  
Purpose: Identify when a system transitions from a productive tool into a parasitic enclosure.  
Scope: Applicable to technical, organizational, civic, economic, and social systems.  
Success Condition: Early detection of parasitic load before irreversible systemic lock-in.

## 1. Variance & Noise — The Slack Test

[ ] **Identification**  
Are human, environmental, or system variances being treated as waste to eliminate rather than slack required for resilience?

[ ] **Novelty Gap**  
Does the system lose functional capacity when exposed to data, behavior, or conditions it was not explicitly trained or designed to handle?

[ ] **Innovation Leaks**  
Are there intentionally un-instrumented or low-control zones where non-standard behavior is tolerated to permit adaptation and discovery?

Failure Signal:  
Elimination of variance → stagnation → first unmodeled surprise causes total failure.

## 2. Enforcement & Extraction — The Metabolic Test

[ ] **Cost Scaling**  
Does the energy, compute, or administrative cost of monitoring a single transaction scale superlinearly as the system approaches total visibility?

[ ] **Triage Threshold**  
Is there an explicit threshold where deviations are ignored because the cost of correction exceeds the value of correction?

[ ] **Parasitic Ratio**  
Is more than 10% of total system energy, revenue, or attention consumed by compliance, surveillance, auditing, and internal enforcement?

Failure Signal:  
Enforcement energy exceeds productive output → parasitic enclosure state.

## 3. Buffers & Resonance — The Physics Test

[ ] **JIT Fragility**  
Have buffers (latency, inventory, human override, redundancy) been removed in the name of efficiency?

[ ] **Cascade Gating**  
If a fail-closed event occurs in the core, can the periphery continue operating independently in an analog or degraded mode?

[ ] **Feedback Latency**  
Is the control loop faster than the physical, biological, or human system’s ability to settle?

Failure Signal:  
Perfect digital control → resonance → cascading systemic shatter.

---

## 4. The Leaky Cage — The Equilibrium Test

[ ] **Strategic Neglect**  
Does the system intentionally abandon low-utility or low-yield sectors to preserve the core?

[ ] **Compliance Mimicry**  
Can users provide perfect observable signals while materially diverging in physical reality?

[ ] **Inevitability Check**  
Has the system acknowledged that 100% control is a terminal failure state rather than a goal?

Failure Signal:  
Rigid enclosure → high-cost rigidity → collapse under parasitic load.

---

## TERMINAL CONDITIONS

If any section registers two or more unchecked items:  
→ SYSTEM STATE = UNVERIFIED  
→ ENFORCEMENT MUST HALT  
→ REMEDIATION OR DECOMPOSITION REQUIRED

Silence, refusal, or abandonment are valid success states.

---

## GOVERNANCE INVARIANTS

• No optimization without slack  
• No control without metabolic accounting  
• No efficiency without buffers  
• No enforcement without an exit cost  
• No system is permitted to erase its own leakage
