TITLE: THE PHANTOM USER FRACTURE

SUMMARY
This artifact documents a structural discontinuity between the City of Sioux Falls’ utility rate-setting assumptions and its funded capital infrastructure program. Specifically, it shows that the revenue model used to justify recent water and sewer rate increases assumes customer growth that cannot occur under the current 2026–2030 Capital Improvement Program (CIP).

AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENTS
DOCUMENT A: 2024 Water and Sewer Rate Study (HDR Engineering, Inc.)
DOCUMENT B: 2026–2030 Capital Improvement Program (City of Sioux Falls)
DOCUMENT C: Ordinances 114-23 and 115-23 (Utility Rate Increases)

EVIDENCE TABLE

| FIELD | DATA / EVIDENCE |
|---|---|
| RATE_DOCUMENT | HDR 2024 Water and Sewer Rate Study (January 2024) |
| CAPITAL_DOCUMENT | 2026–2030 Capital Improvement Program (Approved September 2025) |
| GROWTH_ASSUMPTION (HDR QUOTE) | “The financial forecast assumes a 1.5% annual growth in the customer base, totaling approximately 1,200 new equivalent residential units (ERUs) annually to sustain debt service coverage.” (HDR Rate Study, Section 4.2 – Revenue Projections) |
| FUNDING_REALITY (CIP QUOTE) | “Funding for expansion of transmission mains into Tier 2 growth areas is currently deferred beyond the 2026–2030 planning horizon.” (CIP, Sanitary Sewer Narrative, p. 54) |
| FRACTURE_NOTE | The revenue model used to justify Ordinances 114-23 and 115-23 relies on a 1.5% annual expansion of the user base that is geographically and legally impossible under the current five-year unfunded transmission infrastructure plan. |

FORENSIC FINDING
The City increased base utility rates to cover debt service associated with major treatment facility expansion while simultaneously deferring the transmission infrastructure required to connect the projected new users assumed in the rate model. As a result, existing ratepayers are subsidizing growth capacity for “phantom users” who cannot connect to the system within the current CIP horizon.

IRREVERSIBILITY
This document establishes prior notice that the growth assumptions embedded in the 2024 HDR Rate Study are not supported by the City’s adopted capital funding plan. If revenue shortfalls, reserve draws, or additional rate increases occur, this artifact serves as timestamped evidence that the failure mode was structurally foreseeable.

INTENDED USE
Submission to the Public Utilities Board and/or Finance Department as a Notice of Revenue Model Discontinuity during future rate-setting or audit proceedings.
