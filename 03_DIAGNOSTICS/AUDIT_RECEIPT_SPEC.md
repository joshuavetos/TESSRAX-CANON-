AUDIT RECEIPT SPECIFICATION v1.0
Status: CANON-COMPATIBLE
Authority: CANON-003_Claim_Economy
Purpose: Liability-Grade Proof of Decision Legitimacy
	0.	Definition

An Audit Receipt is a deterministic, append-only artifact emitted for a single decision or action with potential external consequence.

It is not:
   •   A log
   •   An explanation
   •   A narrative
   •   A justification

It is:
   •   A proof of process
   •   A liability boundary
   •   A machine-verifiable contract between system behavior and governing invariants

No decision is considered real without a receipt.
	1.	Receipt Invariants (Hard Requirements)

A valid Audit Receipt MUST satisfy all of the following:
	1.	Atomicity
      •   Exactly one receipt per decision.
      •   Decisions may not share receipts.
	2.	Non-Editable
      •   Receipts are append-only.
      •   Corrections require a new receipt that references the prior receipt_id.
	3.	Evidence-Bound
      •   Every claim listed must reference immutable evidence.
      •   Claims without evidence are automatically UNADJUDICATED.
	4.	Dependency-Closed
      •   All dependencies must be enumerated explicitly.
      •   If any dependency is FAILED, INVALID, or EXPIRED → receipt final_status = FAILED.
	5.	Dual-Readable
      •   Human-legible structure.
      •   Machine-verifiable fields, hashes, and deltas.

Failure to meet any invariant renders the receipt INVALID.
	2.	Receipt Lifecycle

2.1 Emission Trigger

A receipt MUST be emitted whenever the system:
   •   Executes an external action
   •   Makes a prediction relied upon by another system
   •   Alters state outside its own context
   •   Refuses an action under governance rules

Silence produces no receipt.

2.2 States

A receipt exists in exactly one state:
   •   PENDING: Awaiting evidence adjudication
   •   PASSED: All predicates verified; dependencies intact
   •   FAILED: One or more predicates falsified or a dependency collapsed
   •   UNADJUDICATED: Required evidence missing or incomplete
   •   INVALID: Structural violation of this specification

State transitions are irreversible.
	3.	Canonical Receipt Schema

The receipt MUST conform to the following logical schema:

receipt_id: AR-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-
timestamp: ISO-8601
decision_scope: string

governing_canon:
   •   CANON-003_Claim_Economy

claims:
   •   claim_id: string
predicate: MPL boolean expression
tier: observation | prediction | structural
dependencies: [claim_id…]
evidence_refs: [EVD-…]
status: PENDING | PASSED | FAILED

budget_effects:
obs_delta: float
pred_delta: float
struct_delta: float
escrow_used: boolean

evidence_root: sha256:<merkle_root_hash>

final_status: PENDING | PASSED | FAILED | UNADJUDICATED | INVALID

signatures:
system: sha256:<receipt_hash>
human: optional

All numeric deltas MUST reconcile exactly with the Claim Economy ledger.
	4.	Evidence Binding Rules

   •   Evidence MUST reside in /03_DIAGNOSTICS/
   •   Evidence files MUST be immutable, content-addressed blobs named:
EVD--.md
   •   Receipts reference evidence by hash only
   •   Missing evidence forces final_status = UNADJUDICATED
   •   Altered or mismatched evidence forces final_status = FAILED

	5.	Dependency Collapse Interaction

If any dependency listed in a receipt transitions to FAILED, INVALID, or EXPIRED:
   •   The receipt transitions immediately to FAILED
   •   The receipt is masked from future reasoning
   •   All downstream receipts that reference this receipt are SUSPENDED

Receipts are first-class dependency nodes in the system graph.
	6.	Legal and Operational Meaning

A PASSED receipt asserts process legitimacy, not outcome correctness.

A PASSED receipt means:
   •   The system acted within declared rules
   •   All claims were falsifiable
   •   Evidence existed at time of action

It does not mean:
   •   The action was morally correct
   •   The outcome was optimal
   •   The world behaved as predicted

This distinction is intentional and non-negotiable.
	7.	Prohibited Patterns (Receipt Kill Conditions)

Any of the following immediately invalidate a receipt:
   •   Natural-language justification without MPL predicates
   •   Evidence generated by the same agent being evaluated
   •   Retroactive evidence attachment
   •   Omitted dependencies
   •   Budget deltas that do not reconcile
   •   Canon references that are inactive or superseded
   •   Multiple decisions represented in a single receipt
   •   Post-hoc edits to receipt content
   •   Hashes not verifiable by independent computation

	8.	Versioning and Supersession

   •   This specification is versioned and append-only
   •   Changes require a new spec file and a new CANON reference
   •   Older receipts remain valid under the spec version they were emitted with
   •   No receipt is ever rewritten or deleted

End of file.
