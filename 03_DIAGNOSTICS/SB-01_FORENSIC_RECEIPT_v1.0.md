# SB-01 FORENSIC RECEIPT (v1.0)
Artifact Class: Survivable Physical Fix  
Domain: Material Stabilization / Physical Binding Layer (PBL)  
Status: AUDITABLE — FAIL-FAST / FAIL-VISIBLE

---

## 1) ARTIFACT IDENTITY
- Artifact Name: SB-01 Stabilization Kit
- Receipt ID: SB01-FR-2026-001
- Version: v1.0
- Builder: [Redacted / Local Builder]
- Build Date (UTC): __________
- Material Batch IDs: ______________________
- Printer Model / Firmware: ________________

---

## 2) PURPOSE (BOUND)
Arrest vibration, sag, rattle, or misalignment **without permanent alteration**.  
If arrest fails, failure must be **visible and immediate**.

---

## 3) COMPONENT MANIFEST (MINIMAL SET)
- SB-P1 Universal Shim (serrated wedge)
- SB-P2 C-Clamp Brace (tool-less cam-lock)
- SB-P3 Hinge-Reset Spacer (C-profile micro-spacers)
- SB-P4 Gap-Bridge (spring-tension spacer)
- SB-P5 Stress-Distributor (ribbed pressure plate)
- SB-P6 Tether-Lock (releasable ratchet strap)

---

## 4) BUILD PARAMETERS (PRINT-BOUND)
- Material: PETG (preferred) or Nylon; PLA prohibited for load paths
- Layer Height: 0.24 mm (functional) / 0.28 mm (rapid)
- Infill: 35% Gyroid (structural parts); 25% for shims
- Walls: ≥ 4 perimeters (≥ 1.6 mm)
- Orientation: Load axis aligned with layer planes where possible
- Tolerances: ±0.25 mm mating clearance
- Post-Process: None allowed (no drilling, gluing, heat forming)

---

## 5) INSTALLATION CONSTRAINTS (NON-ALTERATION)
- Tools: None
- Fasteners: None penetrating host material
- Removal: Restores host object to prior state (zero material delta)

---

## 6) VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (PASS/FAIL)
**V1 — Arrest Test**
- Apply SB-01 to target.
- Induce motion (hand force / vibration).
- PASS: Motion halts immediately.
- FAIL: Any continued oscillation.

**V2 — Load Reveal**
- Apply incremental load to 120% expected service.
- PASS: No hidden deformation.
- FAIL: Creep without visible slip.

**V3 — Release Test**
- Remove SB-01.
- PASS: Original drift returns.
- FAIL: Host material altered.

---

## 7) FAILURE CRITERIA (MANDATORY HALT)
- Any hidden crack, creep, or heat-softening.
- Any condition where failure is delayed or masked.
- Any reliance on environmental forgiveness (humidity, temperature).

If any criterion is met → **HALT USE**.

---

## 8) CLASSIFICATION (PBL)
- Survivable Fix: YES
- Provisional Fix: NO
- Dangerous Fix: NO

Rationale: Fails fast, fails visible, surfaces drift.

---

## 9) SCOPE & LIABILITY NOTE
This device is a **stabilization aid**, not a structural repair.  
It is functionally equivalent to a furniture pad or doorstop.  
No code alteration, no permanent modification, no concealed state.

---

## 10) AUDIT CHECKSUM
- Visual Evidence Hash (photos/video): ______________________
- Test Log Hash: ______________________
- Witness (optional): ______________________
- Timestamp: ______________________
