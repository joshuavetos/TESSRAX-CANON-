Purpose
Describe a repeatable method for generating lawful, daylight leverage by inserting constraint artifacts into public decision processes.

Trigger Conditions
   •   Active public process with statutory input requirement
   •   Fixed adoption deadline
   •   Publicly accessible primary documents
   •   Obligation to respond or incorporate feedback

Inputs
   •   Official draft documents (PDFs, maps, projections)
   •   Publicly stated claims (growth, capacity, readiness)
   •   Current-state data from the same source set

Method
	1.	Extract explicit claims from draft
	2.	Extract capacity/resource qualifiers
	3.	Construct contrast table (claim vs reality vs gap)
	4.	Submit through official channel
	5.	Ask one procedural question requiring citation

Output
   •   Timestamped public record entry
   •   Forced response or incorporation
   •   Persistent citation surface

Failure Modes
   •   Emotional language
   •   Accusatory framing
   •   Multiple questions
   •   Secondary sources

Success Condition
   •   Obligation transferred from submitter to institution
