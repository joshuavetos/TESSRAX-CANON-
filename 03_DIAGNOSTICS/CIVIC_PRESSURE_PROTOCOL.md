# Method: Daylight Leverage via Constraint Artifacts

## Purpose
Describe a repeatable method for generating lawful, daylight leverage by inserting constraint artifacts into public decision processes.

## Trigger Conditions
Run this method when all of the following are true:
- Active public process with a statutory input requirement  
- Fixed adoption or approval deadline  
- Primary documents are publicly accessible  
- The institution is obligated to respond to or incorporate public feedback  

## Inputs
- Official draft documents (PDFs, maps, projections)  
- Publicly stated claims (growth, capacity, readiness)  
- Current-state data from the same source set  

## Method
1. Extract explicit claims from the draft.  
2. Extract capacity or resource qualifiers.  
3. Construct a contrast table (claim → reality → gap).  
4. Submit the table through the official channel.  
5. Ask **one** procedural question requiring citation.  

## Output
- Timestamped public record entry  
- Forced institutional response or incorporation  
- Persistent citation surface  

## Failure Modes
- Emotional language  
- Accusatory framing  
- More than one question  
- Use of secondary or external sources  

## Success Condition
Obligation transfers from the submitter to the institution.
