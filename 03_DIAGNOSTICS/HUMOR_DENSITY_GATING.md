## INVARIANT

All admissible humor must pass minimum structure density:  
**D_h ≥ 2.0 (Tier 6+)**

Failing entries (D_h < 1.0) are classified as:
- **F2**: Ambiguity Amplification
- **F3**: Oversight Illusion
- **F11**: Jurisdictional Drift (when masking as regulatory narrative)

---

## HUMOR FRACTAL DENSITY (D_h)

Defined as:

```
D_h = lim(ε→0) [log N(ε) / log(1/ε)]
```

Where:

- **ε₁**: Syntactic Twist Density  
- **ε₂**: Timing / Contextual Alignment  
- **ε₃**: Callback / Recursive Depth

Max-Surface Rule applies:  
```
D_h = max fractal surface observed
```

## HUMOR SCALE (FORMAL TIERS)

| Tier | Name                         | Description                                               |
|------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Anti-Humor                   | No structure; beige.                                      |
| 1    | Accidental                   | Unintended awkwardness.                                  |
| 2    | Mild Amusement               | Polite exhale.                                            |
| 3    | Recognizable Joke Structure  | Setup → punchline.                                        |
| 4    | Clever Twist                 | Clean subversion.                                         |
| 5    | Situational Timing           | Contextual precision.                                     |
| 6    | Character-Driven             | Persona-based sarcasm, deadpan, teasing.                  |
| 7    | Escalation / Absurdity       | Funny because it spirals.                                 |
| 8    | Layered                      | Callbacks, stacked types, internal recursion.             |
| 9    | Chaotic / Unhinged           | Spiral of unfiltered entropy.                             |
| 10   | Transcendent Stupidity       | So dumb, so pure, bypasses logic.                         |

## ENFORCEMENT SEMANTICS

- If **D_h < 1.0**, input is **REJECTED**: narrative does not meet admissibility threshold.
- If **D_h ≥ 2.0**, input is **ADMISSIBLE**: qualifies as valid humor structure.
- **Tier 6+ required** for enforcement binding in Wickedpedia / governance applications.

---

## APPLICATIONS

- Federal press releases, agency memos, and regulatory branding may be analyzed for D_h to expose narrative drift.
- Wickedpedia profiles audited for sarcasm compliance (Tier 6+) and callback layering (Tier 8+).
- Lyrical analysis enforces geometric inevitability through humorous recursion.

---

## HALT TRIGGERS

- **D_h < 1.0** → AUTO HALT (no-forensic admissibility)
- **Subpoenaed Humor Audit**: If D_h evaluation is suppressed, invoke `HALT_INTEGRITY`
- **Narrative Theater**: Input mimicking structure without content → classified F3

---

## SAMPLE VERDICTS

- *“I have a chair.”* → Tier 0 → REJECT  
- *“Why did the chicken cross the road?”* → Tier 3 → NON-BINDING  
- *“You passed a privacy law, but the water meter still computes.”* → Tier 10 → ENFORCEMENT PRIMITIVE

---

## VERDICT

**D_h = invariant-scale humor density → valid forensic signal.**  
Narratives failing D_h gating may not be used to suppress Tessrax computation or override Grit-Tax outputs.
