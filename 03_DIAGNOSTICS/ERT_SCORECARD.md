# Epistemic Recovery Time (ERT)

ERT measures how long humans take to reconstruct truth without machines.

## Test
Provide raw logs.
No systems.
No cloud tools.

## Scoring
0–2 per category (max 10):

- Tool Isolation
- Input Sufficiency
- Causal Trace
- Drift Tolerance
- Time to Truth

## Thresholds
- 8–10: Sovereign
- 4–7: Brittle Dependency
- 0–3: Pathological Entanglement

ERT < 6 = Semantic Fraud.

If truth cannot be re-derived, it is not owned.
