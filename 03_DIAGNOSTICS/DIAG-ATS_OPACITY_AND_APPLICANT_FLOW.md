# ATS Opacity and Applicant Flow Asymmetry

## Claim
Employers and hiring platforms are legally required to retain detailed applicant flow data (application, interview, offer, hire stages with demographic attributes), but this data is systematically withheld from candidates. This opacity is not incidental; it is structurally aligned with compliance defense and volume-based revenue incentives.

## Regulatory Basis (Retention Without Disclosure)

### OFCCP — 41 CFR §60-1.12 (Federal Contractors)
- Retention: 2 years from hiring decision
- Required internal records:
  - Applicant flow logs by requisition ID
  - Race / sex / ethnicity at each stage
  - Interview, offer, hire timestamps
  - Selection rate differentials
- Scope: Federal contractors with >50 employees and $50k+ contracts

### EEOC — 29 CFR §1602.14 (Title VII / ADA / ADEA)
- Retention: 1–2 years (2 years for age-related claims)
- Required internal records:
  - All applications and resumes received
  - Interviewee lists
  - Rejection reasons (coded)
  - Personnel records tied to position

### Resulting Asymmetry
Employers are audit-ready with full funnel visibility.
Candidates receive no stage-level outcome data beyond generic rejection notices.

## Functional Consequence: Rejection Laundering

Observed pattern:
- Employers publicly attribute rejection to ATS automation.
- Internally retained flow data captures post-parsing human filtering and demographic stage gaps.
- Aggregate funnel metrics are disclosed only during audits or litigation, never to applicants.

This enables plausible deniability while preserving compliance posture.

## Platform Incentives

Hiring platforms monetize activity, not resolution.

- Recruiter subscriptions (per-seat pricing)
- Sponsored job postings (pay-per-click / per-application)
- ATS SaaS renewals justified by “engagement” and applicant volume

No major platform publishes posting-to-hire conversion ratios.

Opacity preserves:
- Employer willingness to post non-immediate or placeholder roles
- Candidate over-participation despite collapsing yields
- Platform revenue uncorrelated with successful hires

## Diagnostic Conclusion

The hiring market exhibits a structurally enforced information asymmetry:
- Applicant flow data is mandatory to retain
- Mandatory data is non-public by default
- Non-disclosure aligns with both legal defense and revenue preservation

This is a system property, not a tooling failure.

## Falsifiability Conditions

This diagnosis would be invalidated if:
- Platforms published per-requisition posting-to-hire ratios
- Candidates were granted access to anonymized funnel outcomes
- Revenue was primarily tied to successful placements rather than application volume

None of these conditions are currently met.
