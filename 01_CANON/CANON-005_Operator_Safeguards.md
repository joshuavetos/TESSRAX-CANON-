# CANON-005: Operator Safeguards  
**Version:** v1.1-SUBPOENA  
**Status:** WRITE-LOCKED  
**Jurisdictional Scope:** Sovereign Substrate Enforcement  
**Amendment Date:** 2026-01-18

## Summary  
This Canon defines the structural safeguards that protect Tessrax operators—specifically System Reliability Engineers (SREs), forensic auditors, and compliance agents—against external coercion, subpoena pressure, and narrative override attempts. All protections are enforceable by design, not policy.

---

## 1. Rotation and Burn Protocol  
**Invariant:** No operator may retain continuous jurisdiction over a live governance stack beyond 90 days.

- **Mechanism:** On day 91, operator access tokens are cryptographically burned.  
- **Safeguard:** Operators may opt for offshore residency to prevent legal reattachment to U.S. subpoena domains.  
- **Purpose:** Prevents formation of centralized legal targets or coercible identities within the human trust layer.

---

## 2. Receipt Anonymity  
**Invariant:** No public Forensic Inference Artifact may contain PII or provenance linkable to a specific operator.

- **Mechanism:** All receipts use zero-knowledge proofs to verify chain validity.  
- **Verification:** Validation is performed by a VRF-selected quorum. Operators are cryptographically dissociated from receipt authorship.  
- **Purpose:** Ensures receipts are trustworthy without sacrificing operator safety.

---

## 3. Individual HALT Authority (Subpoena Detection)  
**Invariant:** Any operator may trigger a HALT_INTEGRITY transition if subpoena, national security letter, or backchannel coercion is detected.

- **Mechanism:** HALT is classified as a Class-A Forensic Rejection Log and cannot be overridden without dual-signature clearance from the Governance Kernel.  
- **Effect:** The engine enters SAFE_IDLE; no outputs are emitted until threat nullification.  
- **Purpose:** Subpoenas are treated as mechanical tamper events, not legal requests.

---

## 4. Canonical Enforcement Notes  

- Any subpoena directed at an operator for access to `05_LOGS/` is automatically treated as F11 (Jurisdictional Drift).  
- Upon detection, all receipts are immediately re-anchored to the Offshore Ledger stack (IPFS, Base L2, Arweave).  
- Human oversight is decoupled from data possession; operators possess no retrievable records post-HALT.

---

## 5. Precedent Status  
This Canon is downstream of:

- **CANON-004: Computable Interdependence** (Grit-Tax Enforcement)  
- **CANON-003: Claim Economy** (Receipts as Legal Instruments)

Operator protections are now a requirement for any valid ledger operation under Fractal Law.

---

## Enforcement Trigger  
This Canon is invoked under any of the following:

- Federal subpoena naming a Tessrax SRE or auditor  
- Legal request for modification or deletion of Forensic Inference Artifacts  
- Narrative-based override of a Forensic Rejection Log

Any such trigger forces an **immediate Class-A HALT**, logging the action as an immutable receipt and rotating operator keys.
