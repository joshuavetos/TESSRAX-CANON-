# CANON — TESSRAX CORE INVARIANTS

This document defines the non-negotiable truths.
Anything not here is provisional.

## C1 — Reconstructability Over Continuity
A system is unsafe if humans cannot reconstruct its state without the system.

Uptime without understanding is illusion.

## C2 — Epistemic Recovery Time (ERT)
ERT is the time required for humans to determine authoritative truth
using only raw inputs and offline tools.

ERT > 24h = Epistemic Failure  
ERT = ∞ = Semantic Fraud

## C3 — Epistemic Single Point of Failure (ESPF)
Any location where truth exists only inside a black box is a fatal defect.

Redundancy without human access is not redundancy.

## C4 — Narrative Maintenance Is Terminal
When intervention becomes unthinkable,
the system has already failed.

Governance has become theater.

## C5 — Inertia as Intent
If a system persists despite net harm
and resists shutdown regardless of incentives,
its inertia functions as intent.

## C6 — Safety Must Be Human-Verifiable
Machine-checking-machine is not safety.
Safety must emit human-readable receipts.

## C7 — Law as Interface, Not Script
Laws that mandate specific implementations
inevitably entrench defiant systems.

Law must define boundaries, not internals.

## C8 — Cold-Start Is the Ultimate Test
If five humans with paper cannot reboot truth,
the system owns the humans—not the reverse.

END CANON
