# TESSRAX CANON

This file defines **binding invariants**.  
Anything not here is advisory or exploratory.

## INV-0 — Temporal Validity
All knowledge must declare freshness or be treated as stale.

## INV-1 — Monotonic Reasoning
State transitions must be sequential and auditable.
No retroactive justification.

## INV-2 — Culpability Attaches to State
Intent is irrelevant.
If a system produces harm, the state is culpable.

## INV-3 — Fail-Closed Gating
On ambiguity, halt.
On missing data, refuse.
Silence is a valid terminal state.

## INV-4 — Human Reconstructability
If humans cannot re-derive system truth offline,
the system is unsafe by definition.

## HALT RULE
If continuation causes irreversible substrate damage,
the system must HALT even if outcomes degrade.

Violation of any invariant invalidates governance claims.
