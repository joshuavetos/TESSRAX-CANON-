# DOT-VMT-01 — Expansion Debt Dependency vs. State of Good Repair Policy

## Scope
State Department of Transportation financial and compliance documents (2019–2026).

## Documents Reviewed
- Transportation Asset Management Plan (TAMP), [State], [Year]
- Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), [FY Range]
- Official Statement: [Bond Series, Year]

## Policy Commitment
The TAMP commits the agency to a “Fix-It-First / State of Good Repair” framework, prioritizing preservation over capacity expansion as required by 23 CFR Part 515.

## Capital Reality
The STIP allocates material funding to new capacity projects (lane-miles, bypasses, corridors), increasing the asset base requiring future maintenance.

## Financial Dependency
The Official Statement projects debt service coverage based on continued traffic and revenue growth consistent with capacity expansion, not preservation.

## Dependency Fracture
Debt repayment assumes growth that the agency’s own compliance policy constrains. This creates a structural mismatch between:
- Federal compliance obligations,
- Capital programming,
- Revenue assumptions pledged to bondholders.

## Status
PASS — Structural dependency contradiction documented with primary sources.
