## Policy Commitment (TAMP)

The SDDOT Transportation Asset Management Plan defines the agency’s primary objective as:

> “Preserving and maintaining the existing state highway system in a state of good repair using a lowest life-cycle cost approach.”

The TAMP explicitly prioritizes:
- Preservation of existing pavement and bridges
- Compliance with federal State of Good Repair (SOGR) performance targets
- Avoidance of unfunded future maintenance liabilities

The TAMP acknowledges an existing funding gap to maintain current pavement and bridge condition targets over the planning horizon.

---

## Capital Reality (TIP / STIP)

The 2024–2027 Sioux Falls MPO TIP programs the construction of the SD 100 / South Veterans Parkway corridor, a new limited-access arterial facility.

**Programmed Scope Includes:**
- Grading and earthwork
- Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) surfacing
- Curb and gutter
- Storm sewer systems
- Traffic signals
- Roadway lighting

**Programmed Cost:**
- Approximately $57 million within the TIP/STIP window

**Funding Sources:**
- Federal National Highway Performance Program (NHPP)
- Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG)
- State highway funds

This project represents net-new asset creation, not rehabilitation or preservation of existing infrastructure.

## Dependency Fracture

### 1. Asset Inflation vs. Preservation Deficit

The TAMP documents a shortfall in funding required to maintain the existing state highway network at target conditions.

By programming SD 100 / Veterans Parkway, SDDOT:
- Expands the total lane-mile inventory
- Adds long-term maintenance obligations (pavement, signals, lighting, stormwater)
- Increases future preservation liabilities not accounted for in the TAMP funding model

This action structurally contradicts the stated “Fix-It-First” and lowest life-cycle cost strategy.

---

### 2. Urban Growth Dependency Loop

The City of Sioux Falls’ Shape Sioux Falls 2050 Comprehensive Plan designates Tier 2 growth areas that rely on SD 100 / Veterans Parkway for access, traffic capacity, and development feasibility.

As a result:
- State-funded expansion is being used to enable municipal growth that the City itself cannot fully service with utilities
- SDDOT assumes long-term maintenance liability to support local expansion objectives rather than state system preservation needs

---

## Structural Finding

There is a documented inconsistency between:
- SDDOT’s federally required asset management policy prioritizing preservation, and
- The capital programming decision to construct a major new arterial facility that increases the unfunded future maintenance burden.

This constitutes a **Fix-It-First Policy Violation by Expansion**, not through debt issuance, but through deferred preservation obligations.

---

## Status

**PASS** — Primary-source contradiction confirmed between SDDOT asset management policy (TAMP) and programmed capital expansion (TIP/STIP).

---

## Intended Use

Submission to:
- Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), South Dakota Division
- South Dakota Legislative Audit Committee

Purpose:
- Documenting inconsistency between federally approved asset management commitments and state capital programming decisions.
- Establishing prior notice of expansion-driven future maintenance liability.
