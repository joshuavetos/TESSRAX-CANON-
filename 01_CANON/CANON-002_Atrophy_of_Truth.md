# CANON-002: The Atrophy of Truth

## Claim
Automation does not merely remove labor.  
It removes **epistemology**.

When humans stop practicing manual state reconstruction,  
they lose the ability to verify reality without machines.

## Core Insight
The “manual override” of modern systems is not a lever.  
It is **human memory and practice**.

That muscle atrophies first.

## Observable Effects
- Availability replaces reconstructability  
- Uptime metrics replace understanding  
- Truth becomes whatever the system reports  
- Humans become narrative front‑ends for machine state  

## Result
Institutions remain operational while becoming epistemically bankrupt.

They can no longer prove:
- who owns what  
- what is owed  
- what actually happened  

without the system telling them.

## Implication
Sovereign inertia is not merely institutional.  
It is biological.

## Status
CANONICAL
