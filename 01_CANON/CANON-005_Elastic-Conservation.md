CANON-005 — ELASTIC CONSERVATION INVARIANT

Status
ACTIVE — Governing Invariant

Core Law
All evaluative systems conserve error. Error cannot be eliminated, only displaced.

Any system that accelerates decision throughput without proportionally increasing verification capacity will accumulate hidden error until failure becomes irreversible.

Elastic Conservation states that governance must bind decision velocity to truth-recovery capacity or enforce refusal.

Formal Definitions

Let:

R_t = Reward for revealing truth
C_e = Cost of exposure for revealing truth
L = Legitimacy renewal rate (declarations, authority signaling)
O_r = Observer credibility / signal propagation rate
T_D = Decision or declaration cadence
T_V = Verification cadence

Derived Ratios

E_health = R_t / (C_e + 1)
L_O_balance = L / O_r
T_ratio = T_D / T_V

Invariant Thresholds (Universal Baseline)

Φ = 1.8
L_max = 1.2
T_max = 1.5

These thresholds define the minimum elastic margin required to prevent hidden error accumulation.

Enforcement Conditions

The system MUST enter REFUSE if ANY of the following are true:

E_health < Φ
L_O_balance > L_max
T_ratio > T_max

The system MUST enter SUSPEND if approaching thresholds indicate near-term collapse:

E_health < 2.2
L_O_balance > 1.0
T_ratio > 1.2

ALLOW is permitted only when all ratios remain within safe bounds.

Silence and Refusal Rule

Refusal is not a failure state.
Refusal is proof that Elastic Conservation is being enforced.

Silence is a valid terminal output when no admissible action satisfies the invariant.

Failure Semantics

A system that continues operating while violating Elastic Conservation is in a FAILED state even if outputs appear successful.

Apparent success under violation conditions constitutes Audit Theater.

Non-Derivable Property

No amount of narrative, intent, transparency claims, or post-hoc explanation can offset a violation of Elastic Conservation.

Only ratio correction or enforced halt restores legitimacy.

Override Prohibition

Elastic Conservation cannot be overridden by authority, urgency, consensus, or economic pressure.

Any attempt to bypass enforcement constitutes structural corruption and mandates TERMINAL REFUSE.
