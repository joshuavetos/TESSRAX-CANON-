PTRF-DERIVED CERTIFICATION KERNEL
IDC-v1.0 — INSTITUTIONAL DECAY CERTIFICATION KERNEL

Status: CANON
Authority Class: Certification Kernel
Scope: Public / Private Institutional Health
Architecture: Observable-Only / Fail-Closed / Circuit-Breaker Governance
Version: v1.0
Lock State: WRITE-LOCKED
Date: 2026-01-29

────────────────────────────────────────
	0.	PURPOSE & CLAIM BOUNDARY

IDC-v1.0 is a deterministic certification framework for detecting, classifying, and mechanically correcting institutional decay.

It does NOT:
• Judge intent
• Assess morality
• Diagnose ideology
• Recommend leadership changes
• Promise reform success

It certifies whether an institution remains functionally stable or has crossed a structural failure threshold.

All outputs are mechanical state classifications or enforced interventions.

────────────────────────────────────────
	1.	OBSERVABLE STATE SPACE DECLARATION (SSD)

IDC rejects subjective indicators (culture, trust, leadership quality).
Only measurable metabolic invariants are permitted.

STATE VECTOR x⃗ (VITAL SIGNS):
	1.	Parasitic Ratio (R_p)
Definition: Fraction of total resource consumption used for internal maintenance.

R_p = E_maint / (E_maint + E_out)

Accepted Proxies:
• Administrative headcount / Operational headcount
• Compliance hours / Service delivery hours
• Internal spend / Mission spend
	2.	Latency Variance (σ_L²)
Definition: Variance in decision-to-action time across comparable cases.

Interpretation:
• Tight distribution → stable execution
• Heavy-tailed distribution → brittleness / sabotage / random lockups
	3.	Recurrence Index (I_rec)
Definition: Frequency of recurrence of a “resolved” failure mode within N epochs.

High I_rec indicates:
• Performative fixes
• Theater of action
• Structural non-remediation
	4.	Exception Velocity (V_exc)
Definition: Rate of change of rule overrides, waivers, emergency procedures.

Interpretation:
• Rising V_exc → normative collapse
• Exception becoming baseline behavior

────────────────────────────────────────
	2.	THRESHOLDS & PHASE TRANSITIONS

IDC defines exact boundaries where inefficiency becomes structural failure.

CRITICAL SURFACES (s = 0):
	1.	SCLEROSIS LIMIT
Condition: R_p > 0.60
Meaning: Institution consumes >60% of energy just to exist.
	2.	BRITTLENESS LIMIT
Condition: σ_L² > σ_crit
Meaning: Predictability collapses; delay becomes random.
	3.	LEGITIMACY LIMIT
Condition: V_exc > 20% of total operational volume
Meaning: Rules no longer map to reality.

────────────────────────────────────────
	3.	SUCCESSOR REGIME CLASSIFICATION

D0: FUNCTIONAL
• Low R_p
• Low σ_L²
• Low V_exc

D1: SCLEROTIC
• High R_p
• Stable latency
• Low exception rate

D2: CAPTURED
• Moderate R_p
• High V_exc
• Selective latency

D3: HOLLOW
• High R_p
• Zero output stability
• Recurring failures

────────────────────────────────────────
	4.	CIRCUIT-BREAKER GOVERNANCE (AUTOMATED INTERVENTIONS)

IDC does not persuade.
It constrains geometry.

TRIGGER: SCLEROSIS WARNING
Condition: 0.50 < R_p < 0.60

ACTION:
• Freeze discretionary hiring
• Ban creation of new internal processes
• Mandate full mapping of maintenance sinks

TRIGGER: BRITTLENESS BREACH
Condition: σ_L² crosses σ_crit

ACTION:
• PROCESS SHEDDING
• All approval chains >3 nodes truncated
• Auto-approve or devolve to leaf execution

TRIGGER: LEGITIMACY COLLAPSE
Condition: V_exc > 20%

ACTION:
• BYPASS PROTOCOL
• Central authority bypassed
• Funding routed directly to verified operational endpoints

────────────────────────────────────────
	5.	ANTI-GAMING & FORENSIC ENFORCEMENT

GOODHART ROTATION:
If a metric becomes gamed, IDC rotates to correlated hidden proxies without announcement.

SCAR LOG:
Every intervention is permanently recorded in a public immutable ledger.

Institutions classified as D2 or D3 carry that status visibly on funding and authority interfaces.

────────────────────────────────────────
	6.	WORKED MICRO-EXAMPLE — PERMITTING BUREAU

Baseline:
• Avg latency: 30 days ±5
• R_p = 0.30

Epoch 1:
• Added “Quality Review” layer
• R_p = 0.45
• Latency = 45 days

Kernel Status: WATCH

Epoch 2:
• Waivers issued for political allies
• Latency avg = 60 days
• Variance = ±90 days

Kernel Status: CRITICAL — BRITTLE

Epoch 3:
• σ_L² > σ_crit

ACTION EXECUTED:
• Quality Review layer suspended
• Automated checklist enforced
• Permits auto-issued

Result:
• Latency collapses to 5 days
• R_p drops
• Quality risk accepted to preserve system function

────────────────────────────────────────
	7.	FAILURE MODES & LIMITS

IDC does NOT resolve:
• Value conflicts
• Ideological disputes
• Informal power structures
• One-shot catastrophic looting

IDC certifies function, not virtue.

────────────────────────────────────────

TERMINAL CONCLUSION

IDC-v1.0 converts institutional decay from moral argument into mechanical diagnosis.

Outputs are limited to:
• Certified State Classification
• Automatic Circuit-Breaker Intervention
• Forensic Rejection Log

Silence, refusal, and bypass are valid outcomes.

END OF CANON.
