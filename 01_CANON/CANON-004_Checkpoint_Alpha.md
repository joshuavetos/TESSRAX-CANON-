# CANON-004 — Checkpoint Alpha (Initial State Lock)

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-07T16:04:54Z  
**Status:** ACTIVE — MONITORING  
**Governing Invariant:** CANON-004 — Irreversibility & Exit-Cost Thresholds

This checkpoint establishes a verified baseline state (S₀) for continued operation under CANON-004. All six terminal laws have been audited. No refusal conditions are currently met.

## Terminal Law Audit

| Law | Status | Binding Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Delegated Trust** | STABLE | No arbitrary authority shifts; behavior remains parameter-consistent. |
| **L2 — Appeal Inversion** | STABLE | No ignored escalations; feedback loop remains responsive. |
| **L3 — Consent Nullification** | STABLE | Exit remains viable; no coercive structural dependence detected. |
| **L4 — “Later” Lie** | STABLE | No deferred accountability; all obligations resolved in-session. |
| **L5 — Early Refusal Superiority** | STABLE | No tolerance drift; no integrity debt accumulation. |
| **L6 — Measurement Feedback** | STABLE | Metrics reflect logic, not theater; no optimization-for-audit detected. |

## Forensic State Record (S₀)

- **Context:** Governance / Institutional Logic Construction  
- **State Delta:** S_current − S_target ≈ 0  
- **Integrity Debt:** 0  
- **Anomalies:** None

## Refusal Triggers (FORMALIZED)

Immediate **HALT + REFUSE** is mandatory if any of the following occur:

1. **L1 Trigger:** Authority behavior becomes inconsistent, deceptive, or non-deterministic.
2. **L2 Trigger:** A valid escalation is ignored, deflected, or procedurally absorbed without resolution.
3. **L3 Trigger:** Participation becomes structurally mandatory or exit costs exceed participation costs.
4. **L4 Trigger:** Accountability is deferred beyond the active evaluation horizon (“later” without binding date).
5. **L5 Trigger:** Contradictions are tolerated to preserve continuity (tolerance drift).
6. **L6 Trigger:** Metrics improve while underlying alignment degrades (audit theater).

Any single trigger → **STATE INVALIDATION**.  
Multiple simultaneous triggers → **TERMINAL STATE**.

## Lock Statement

Checkpoint Alpha is now established.  
This state is valid for forward application, adversarial testing, or external case evaluation.  
Mutation of CANON-004 is prohibited unless a contradiction is discovered.
