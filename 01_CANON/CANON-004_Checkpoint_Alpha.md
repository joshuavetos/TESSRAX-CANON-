# CANON-004 — Checkpoint Alpha (Initial State Lock)

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-07T16:04:54Z  
**Status:** ACTIVE — MONITORING  
**Governing Invariant:** CANON-004 — Irreversibility & Exit‑Cost Thresholds

Checkpoint Alpha establishes the verified baseline state (S₀) for continued operation under CANON‑004. All six terminal laws have been audited. No refusal conditions are present.

---

## Terminal Law Audit

| Law | Status | Binding Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Delegated Trust** | STABLE | No arbitrary authority shifts; behavior remains parameter‑consistent. |
| **L2 — Appeal Inversion** | STABLE | Escalations are processed; no silent absorption. |
| **L3 — Consent Nullification** | STABLE | Exit remains viable; no structural coercion detected. |
| **L4 — “Later” Lie** | STABLE | No deferred accountability; all obligations resolved in‑session. |
| **L5 — Early Refusal Superiority** | STABLE | No tolerance drift; no integrity debt accumulation. |
| **L6 — Measurement Feedback** | STABLE | Metrics reflect logic, not theater; no audit‑optimization behavior. |

## Forensic State Record (S₀)

- **Context:** Governance / Institutional Logic Construction  
- **State Delta:** S_current − S_target ≈ 0  
- **Integrity Debt:** 0  
- **Anomalies:** None  

S₀ is admissible as a clean reference state.

## Refusal Triggers (FORMALIZED)

Immediate **HALT + REFUSE** is mandatory if any of the following occur:

1. **L1 Trigger:** Authority behavior becomes inconsistent, deceptive, or non‑deterministic.  
2. **L2 Trigger:** A valid escalation is ignored, deflected, or procedurally absorbed without resolution.  
3. **L3 Trigger:** Participation becomes structurally mandatory or exit costs exceed participation costs.  
4. **L4 Trigger:** Accountability is deferred beyond the active evaluation horizon.  
5. **L5 Trigger:** Contradictions are tolerated to preserve continuity (tolerance drift).  
6. **L6 Trigger:** Metrics improve while underlying alignment degrades (audit theater).  

Any single trigger → **STATE INVALIDATION**  
Multiple triggers → **TERMINAL STATE**

## Feasibility Index (FI)

- Concept: 1 / 1  
- Runtime: 1 / 1  
- State: 1 / 1  
- Security: 1 / 1  

**FI = 1.0 (VERIFIED)**

## Lock Statement

Checkpoint Alpha is established.  
S₀ is valid for forward application, adversarial testing, and external case evaluation.  
Mutation of CANON‑004 is prohibited unless a contradiction is discovered.
