CANON-004 — COMPUTABLE INTERDEPENDENCE
Status: CANON
Type: Capability Invariant
Date: 2026-01-18

CLAIM
Interdependence is computable.

Social, infrastructural, and collective dependency can be measured deterministically from aggregate infrastructure usage and profit, without machine learning, discretion, narrative judgment, or individual-level data.

This is a capability claim, not a moral argument.

MECHANISM
Let infrastructure classes i ∈ {human, digital, physical, research}.

Dependency_Value = Σ (Usage_i × Weight_i)

Interdependence_Index = normalize(Dependency_Value)

Reciprocity_Dividend = Profit × Sector_Rate × Interdependence_Index

All terms are observable, auditable, and reproducible.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-DERIVABLE)
1. Deterministic math only. No ML, heuristics, or inference.
2. Stateless computation. No hidden memory or adaptive behavior.
3. Versioned, fixed weights only. Weight changes require explicit version bump.
4. Receipts must be hashable and re-computable by any third party.
5. No individual-level data. Aggregate telemetry only.
6. k-anonymity enforced at ingestion. Core engine never sees raw data.
7. Structural measurement only. Individuals are never evaluated.

RESULT
Collective dependency becomes a mechanical property of systems rather than a political or moral debate.

This invariant terminates narrative laundering of “self-made” claims by binding profit to demonstrable infrastructure dependence.
