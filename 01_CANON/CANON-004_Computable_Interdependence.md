CANON-004 — COMPUTABLE INTERDEPENDENCE
Status: CANON
Type: Capability Invariant
Date: 2026-01-18

CLAIM
Interdependence is computable.

Social, infrastructural, and collective dependency can be measured deterministically from aggregate infrastructure usage and profit, without machine learning, discretion, narrative judgment, or individual-level data.

This is a capability claim, not a moral argument.

MECHANISM
Let infrastructure classes i ∈ {human, digital, physical, research}.

Dependency_Value = Σ (Usage_i × Weight_i)

Interdependence_Index = normalize(Dependency_Value)

Reciprocity_Dividend = Profit × Sector_Rate × Interdependence_Index

All terms are observable, auditable, and reproducible.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-DERIVABLE)
1. Deterministic math only. No ML, heuristics, or inference.
2. Stateless computation. No hidden memory or adaptive behavior.
3. Versioned, fixed weights only. Weight changes require explicit version bump.
4. Receipts must be hashable and re-computable by any third party.
5. No individual-level data. Aggregate telemetry only.
6. k-anonymity enforced at ingestion. Core engine never sees raw data.
7. Structural measurement only. Individuals are never evaluated.

RESULT
Collective dependency becomes a mechanical property of systems rather than a political or moral debate.

This invariant terminates narrative laundering of “self-made” claims by binding profit to demonstrable infrastructure dependence.

# CANON-004 — Computable Interdependence (Fractal Amendment)

## Status
AMENDED — FRACTAL SCALING ENABLED  
Authority: Pre-Canon Hardening Passed (Sioux Falls Entities #001, #002)  
Mutation Class: SCALE-INVARIANT UPGRADE (NON-DERIVABLE)

---

## Purpose

This amendment replaces linear dependency aggregation with a scale-invariant computation to prevent Resolution Laundering and to surface Invisible Subsidies that emerge only at sub-jurisdictional resolution.

Linear aggregation (Σ Usage_i × Weight_i) is insufficient beyond narrow scopes. Interdependence is a structural property that persists across scales.

---

## Definition: Fractal Interdependence Index

Interdependence is computed as a box-counting dimension over governance substrates.

D_f = lim(ε → 0) [ log N(ε) / log(1 / ε) ]

Where:
- ε = scale of observation (e.g., utility node, zoning unit, corridor, grant program)
- N(ε) = count of governance boxes at scale ε required to cover the entity’s operational dependency footprint

---

## Mandatory Scales

All audits MUST evaluate at minimum:

- ε₁: Municipal micro-scale  
  (utility nodes, easements, emergency services, block-level infrastructure)

- ε₂: Municipal / regional macro-scale  
  (zoning variances, right-of-way access, administrative overrides)

- ε₃: State / federal coupling  
  (grants, corridors, research funding, regulatory abeyance)

Failure to compute any mandated scale triggers F2 (Ambiguity Amplification).

---

## Structural Invariants

1. Scale Invariance  
   Interdependence MUST remain constant or increase as ε → 0.  
   Any decrease indicates hidden dependency and triggers forensic expansion.

2. Max-Surface Rule  
   Enforcement calculations MUST bind to the maximum D_f observed at any ε.  
   Claims of independence at higher scales are invalidated by lower-scale extraction.

3. Self-Similarity Check  
   Sub-units (facilities, portfolios, regions) MUST exhibit extraction signatures consistent with the parent entity. Divergence triggers F7 (Role Ambiguity).

---

## Enforcement Semantics

- Narrative constructs (e.g., “economic emergency”) are invalid inputs.  
- If a political or administrative action preserves access to a dependency node, that action is itself a counted box N(ε).

Interdependence is mechanical or it is ignored.

---

## Failure Modes Addressed

- Resolution Laundering (linear averaging masking local extraction)
- Authority Laundering via jurisdictional scale-shifting
- Infrastructure Debt obfuscated as “routine compliance”

---

## Canonical Outcome

Fractal Interdependence is now the authoritative computation for CANON-004.

Linear aggregation MAY be retained for telemetry only.  
All enforcement, scorecards, and audits MUST use D_f.

---

## Freeze Clause

This amendment is write-locked pending contradiction by a third, lower-ε counterexample that produces no new extraction signal.

Absent that, this law stands.
