# CANON-005: Visibility Collapse Invariant

## Statement
Visibility is a one-way phase transition in power systems.

Once a power asymmetry becomes perceptible to an affected agent, the system irreversibly exits the state of deniability. The option to “ignore” the asymmetry is destroyed within that agent’s decision context.

## Definitions
- **S_opaque**: A system state where structural coercion exists but can be plausibly denied.
- **S_resolved**: A system state where coercion is perceptible and denial is no longer viable.
- **Visibility Event**: The moment an agent perceives the asymmetry governing their options.
- **Superposition of Consent**: The pre-visibility condition where participation can be framed as voluntary despite structural constraint.

## Invariant
The transition S_opaque → S_resolved is irreversible for the observing agent.

Visibility cannot be “unseen” without loss of agency, memory, or credibility. Systems may attempt to reintroduce opacity socially, legally, or narratively, but the observing agent cannot return to the prior decision topology.

## Consequences
After visibility collapse:
- The “Ignore” option is eliminated.
- All remaining actions incur explicit cost.
- Enforcement pressure becomes observable.

## Violence as Residue
Violence (kinetic, legal, economic, reputational) is not the source of power.
It is the residual friction produced when an agent attempts to occupy a state rendered inaccessible by visibility.

Violence is the cost of misaligned state occupancy after collapse.

## Relation to CANON-004 (Exit-Cost)
- **Exit-Cost** governs *where* irreversibility settles.
- **Visibility Collapse** governs *when* irreversibility becomes unavoidable.

They are orthogonal, compatible invariants.

## Falsification Test
This canon fails if a system demonstrates:
1. Power asymmetry becomes visible,
2. Deniability is fully restored for the same agent,
3. The agent re-enters S_opaque without loss or compensation.

No verified instance currently exists.

## Notes
Reforms that do not alter visibility dynamics are redistributive, not structural.
Opacity preservation is a primary power-maintenance strategy.
