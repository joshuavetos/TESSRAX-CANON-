# CANON-004: The Collapse of Denial (Visibility as a Power Modifier)

## Classification
No detectable failure.

## Core Claim
Power remains deniable while opaque.  
Once power becomes perceptible, optionality collapses.

Visibility is not a narrative moment; it is a **phase-shift** in system state.

---

## Formalization

Let:
- S_opaque be a system state in which coercive structure exists but is not perceptually resolved.
- S_resolved be a system state in which power is perceptible to affected agents.

**Visibility Event (V):**
V : S_opaque → S_resolved

This transition is **irreversible**.

---

## The Superposition of Consent

While in S_opaque, the system maintains a *Superposition of Consent*:
- Participation can be claimed as voluntary
- Coercion can be denied
- Responsibility can be diffused
- Exit appears theoretically available

This state persists only while power is not perceived.

---

## Visibility as Wavefunction Collapse

Visibility functions as a collapse operator:

- Observation deletes the third state (Ignore)
- The system resolves into a binary:
  - Submit
  - Resist

Optionality is destroyed at the moment of perception.

There is no neutral response to visible power.

---

## Violence as Residue

Violence is not the primary mechanism of power.
It is the **residue** generated when an agent attempts to occupy a state rendered inaccessible by Visibility.

Violence may be:
- Kinetic
- Legal
- Financial
- Reputational
- Administrative

Form is incidental. Irreversibility is not.

---

## Modifier: VISIBILITY

**MODIFIER_VISIBILITY**
- Visibility reduces system entropy to 1.
- Once applied, deniability cannot be restored.
- All downstream actions inherit irreversibility.

Visibility converts structural coercion into resolved force.

---

## Diagnostic Implication

If a system offers:
- Remedies instead of reversal
- Compensation instead of unwinding
- Process instead of exit

Then visibility has already occurred, and irreversibility has already been assigned.

---

## Canonical Statement

**Visibility is the end of choice.**

Not because violence is inevitable—
but because denial is no longer available.

---

## Relation to POWER_INVARIANT

This canon extends POWER_INVARIANT by identifying **Perception** as the trigger that collapses optionality.

Power is defined by irreversibility.
Visibility defines **when** irreversibility becomes unavoidable.
