# CANON-005 — Visibility and Irreversibility

## Status
CANONICAL — foundational transition rule

## Claim (Core Invariant)
When power becomes visible to an affected agent, the option to ignore it is permanently deleted within that agent’s decision context.

Visibility is a one-way gate.

## Definitions

**Power**  
The ability of an actor to commit a state transition whose inverse cost cannot be borne by another actor.

**Visibility**  
The moment an affected agent correctly perceives the location and mechanism of irreversibility assignment.

**Superposition of Consent**  
A pre-visibility state in which agents can plausibly claim voluntary participation because coercive structure remains deniable, complex, or obscured.

**Ignore Option**  
The ability of an agent to continue behavior as if power asymmetry does not exist, without immediate consequence.

## Transition Rule

Let:
- Sₒₚₐqᵤₑ = system state with deniability intact  
- Sᵥᵢₛ = system state after perception  
- A = affected agent  

Transition:

Sₒₚₐqᵤₑ → Sᵥᵢₛ occurs at the moment of perception.

Once the transition occurs:
- The Ignore option is deleted.
- The agent must choose among responses that acknowledge power.
- The transition is irreversible for that agent’s decision context.

Re-opacity at the system level does not restore the Ignore option for the agent who has perceived.

## Consequences

1. **Binary Collapse (Minimal Form)**  
   Visibility collapses the choice set by removing Ignore.  
   Remaining actions may be many (submit, resist, bargain, coordinate, defect), but all acknowledge the power asymmetry.

2. **Violence as Residue**  
   Violence is not the source of power.  
   It is the enforcement cost generated when an agent attempts to occupy the now-inaccessible Ignore state after visibility.

   This includes:
   - Kinetic violence
   - Legal force
   - Financial penalties
   - Reputational destruction
   - Administrative exclusion

   All are mechanisms of irreversibility imposition.

3. **Why Systems Resist Visibility**
   Power structures invest in:
   - Complexity
   - Proceduralism
   - “Both sides” framing
   - Voluntary participation rhetoric

   These are anti-visibility tactics designed to preserve Superposition of Consent.

## Boundary Conditions

- Visibility is agent-relative, not globally absolute.
- An agent who has not perceived may still occupy Sₒₚₐqᵤₑ.
- Deliberate forgetting or normalization does not restore the Ignore option once perception has occurred.
- Visibility may be delayed, but not reversed.

## Relationship to Other Canon

- **CANON-004 (Exit-Cost):**  
  Defines *where* irreversibility settles (spatial distribution).

- **CANON-005 (this document):**  
  Defines *when* irreversibility becomes unavoidable (temporal trigger).

They are orthogonal and compatible.

## Falsification Test

This canon fails if a verified case exists where:
1. Power becomes visible to an agent,
2. Deniability is restored for that agent,
3. The Ignore option becomes viable again.

No confirmed case currently satisfies all three.

## Summary (Non-Interpretive)

Power persists by hiding irreversibility.
Reform fails when it redistributes benefits without triggering visibility.
Once power is seen, denial is no longer an option.
