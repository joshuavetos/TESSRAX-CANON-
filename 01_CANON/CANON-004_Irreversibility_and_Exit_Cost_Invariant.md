# CANON-004 — Irreversibility and Exit-Cost Invariant

## Status
CANON — Structural Invariant

## Core Claim
Power in complex systems is determined by who can commit irreversible state changes while retaining the ability to exit without carrying the resulting costs.

Durable reform does not arise from redistribution, fairness, or intent.
It arises only when **exit ceases to be a free escape from irreversibility**.

---

## Definitions

**Irreversibility**
A state transition whose inverse is economically, physically, temporally, or politically infeasible.

Examples:
- Illness progression
- Environmental damage
- Account termination
- Career path truncation
- Data or workflow lock-in
- Debt obligation
- Institutional collapse

**Exit**
The ability of an actor to remove themselves from a system or decision context without bearing the permanent residue created by that system.

**Exit-without-cost**
The dominant form of power.  
The actor escapes while downstream parties absorb irreversibility.

## The Exit-Cost Invariant

> A system is structurally unjust not because harm exists,  
> but because some actors can externalize irreversibility by exiting.

> A system becomes stable only when exit carries the irreversibility with it.

This yields the invariant:

**If exit is cheaper than repair, irreversibility will always be externalized.**

## Why Redistribution Fails

Most reforms:
- Redistribute benefits
- Rebalance incentives
- Offer compensation
- Promise accountability

But they **do not relocate irreversibility absorption**.

They preserve eject buttons.

Examples of failure modes:
- Fines instead of reversal
- Bailouts instead of unwind
- Damages instead of restoration
- “Balancing interests” rhetoric
- Voluntary compliance (CSR)

These are signals that irreversibility assignment remains unchanged.

---

## Exit-Cost as the Only Durable Lever

The only reforms that persist are those that:

- Preserve exit **but**
- Attach a permanent, inescapable cost proportional to the benefit received

This converts exit from an escape hatch into a burden-carrying path.

### Canonical Examples
- Strict liability (no disclaimer-based exit)
- FDIC seizure authority (banks cannot flee insolvency)
- Right-to-repair mandates (lock-in structurally blocked)
- Open standards with procurement enforcement

### Hypothetical but Mechanistically Correct Extensions
- Exit taxes proportional to public system dependency
- Continuous benefit clawbacks after system exit
- Post-tenure liability for decision-makers
- Capacity-based accountability without private escape routes

## Design Principle

> Systems do not become humane.
> They become humane only when externalization becomes more expensive than internalization.

This is not a moral claim.
It is a structural law.

---

## Predictive Power

This invariant predicts:
- Why CSR fails
- Why platform governance is theatrical
- Why single-payer systems retain hidden eject buttons
- Why most “radical” reforms are conservative
- Why power concentrates at settlement, identity, and termination layers
- Why true reform is rare and violently resisted

---

## Relationship to Other CANON

- Extends **CANON-003 (Claim Economy)** by identifying exit as the primary claim-escape vector
- Reinforces **fail-closed** governance primitives
- Aligns with **irreversibility as substrate** rather than outcome

---

## Falsification Criteria

This invariant would be falsified by:
A large-scale, durable, influential system in which:
- Exit costs are symmetric
- Irreversibility is not externalizable
- No actor can offload permanent residue

No such system is currently known.
