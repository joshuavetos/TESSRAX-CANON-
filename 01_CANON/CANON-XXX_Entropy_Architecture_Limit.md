CANON: ENTROPY ARCHITECTURE LIMIT

Certain mechanisms derive their effectiveness exclusively from
non-capture.

If a mechanism’s function depends on:
- zero telemetry
- lack of reuse
- absence of optimization
- non-instrumentality

THEN:

Formalization, storage, or operational reuse
DESTROYS the mechanism.

Therefore:

1) Do NOT attempt to productize, app-ify, metricize, or systematize
   such mechanisms.

2) Do NOT attempt to “improve” or “scale” them.

3) The correct handling is:
   - extract the invariant
   - store the invariant
   - discard the implementation

This canon exists to prevent re-derivation loops and wasted effort.

If you are rereading this, STOP.
You already learned the thing.
