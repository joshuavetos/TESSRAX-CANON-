# CANON-004 — Elastic Conservation of Truth

## Status
CANONICAL — ENFORCEMENT LAW  
Supersedes informal incentive models.  
Compatible with existing Refusal Triggers L1–L6.

---

## Statement (Law)

Truth stability in any measured system is governed by two coupled constraints:

1. **Incentive Elasticity**
2. **Legitimacy Conservation**

If either constraint is violated, hidden risk accumulates monotonically until external collapse resets trust.

---

## Law 1 — Incentive Elasticity

The probability of truthful reporting depends on the ratio between
reward for truth and cost of exposure.

### Formal Object

Pₜ = 1 − e^(−k(Rₜ / Cₑ − 1)),  k > 0

Where:
- Rₜ = subjective reward for surfacing failure
- Cₑ = perceived exposure cost (career, delay, retaliation)

### Elastic Threshold (Φ)

There exists a critical threshold Φ ≈ 1.6–2.0 such that:

- Rₜ / Cₑ < Φ  → truth decays exponentially
- Rₜ / Cₑ ≥ Φ → truth self-propagates

Below Φ, compliance rituals replace detection.

---

## Law 2 — Legitimacy Conservation

In oversight systems, unreported risk cannot be eliminated — only displaced.

### Formal Object

dH/dt = α(L − Oᵣ),  α > 0

Where:
- H = hidden risk mass
- L = legitimacy renewal rate
- Oᵣ = observer credibility (signal reaching decision authority)

If L > Oᵣ, hidden risk increases monotonically.

---

## Coupled Stability Criterion

A system is epistemically stable **iff**:

E_health = Rₜ / (Cₑ + Lₜ) ≥ Φ  
AND  
L ≤ Oᵣ

Where Lₜ is legitimacy cost of dissent.

Violation of either condition guarantees audit theater.

## Relation to Existing Refusal Triggers

This law formally grounds:

- **L4** — Deferred accountability
- **L5** — Tolerance drift
- **L6** — Metrics improve while alignment degrades

L6 is not a moral failure.
It is a **mathematical inevitability** under violated elasticity.

---

## Canonical Consequence

When legitimacy renews faster than truth can afford to surface,
**refusal is not optional**.

Any system that continues execution under violated elasticity
is operating in a false-valid state.

---

## Canonical Clause

Silence under misaligned incentives is not neutrality.  
It is risk accumulation.

Truth does not disappear.  
It waits.
