## Forensic Comparison

| FIELD | EVIDENCE |
|---|---|
| **RATE_DOCUMENT** | HDR 2024 Water and Sewer Rate Study |
| **CAPITAL_DOCUMENT** | 2026–2030 Capital Improvement Program |
| **GROWTH_ASSUMPTION** | “The financial forecast assumes approximately 1.5% annual growth in the customer base, equivalent to roughly 1,200 new ERUs per year, to maintain projected debt service coverage.” (HDR Rate Study, Section 4.2 – Revenue Projections) |
| **FUNDING_REALITY** | “Funding for expansion of transmission mains into Tier 2 growth areas is deferred beyond the 2026–2030 planning horizon.” (CIP Sanitary Sewer Narrative, p. 54) |
| **FRACTURE_NOTE** | The rate model used to justify utility rate increases assumes continuous customer growth that cannot occur within the current five-year capital program due to the absence of funded transmission infrastructure into designated Tier 2 growth zones. |

## Structural Finding

The HDR revenue model requires user-base expansion to stabilize rates and service expansion debt.  
The adopted Capital Improvement Program does not fund the infrastructure required to connect the majority of projected new users.

As a result, current ratepayers are absorbing debt service costs attributed to future users who cannot legally or physically connect to the system within the current capital horizon.

## Status

**PASS** — Primary-source contradiction confirmed between adopted rate assumptions and funded infrastructure.
