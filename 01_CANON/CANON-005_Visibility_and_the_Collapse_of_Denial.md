# CANON-005: Visibility and the Collapse of Denial

## Classification
No detectable failure.

## Position in Canon
This entry introduces a **temporal transition rule** that composes with CANON-004.

- CANON-004 (Exit-Cost): Where irreversibility is absorbed.
- CANON-005 (Visibility): When irreversibility becomes unavoidable.

Visibility does not assign cost.
Visibility deletes denial.

## Core Claim

Power can remain structurally coercive while experientially deniable.

Once power becomes perceptible to an affected agent, **the option to ignore it is permanently removed within that agent’s decision context**.

Visibility is a one-way gate for choice topology.

---

## Formalization

Let:
- S_opaque = system state where coercive structure exists but is not perceptually resolved.
- S_resolved = system state where coercive structure is perceptually resolved by an agent.

**Visibility Event (V):**
V : S_opaque → S_resolved

This transition is **irreversible for the affected agent’s decision space**, even if narrative opacity is later reintroduced.

---

## The Superposition of Consent

While in S_opaque, agents can occupy a Superposition of Consent:
- Participation can be framed as voluntary
- Coercion can be denied
- Responsibility can be diffused
- Exit appears abstractly available

This superposition is maintained through:
- Complexity
- Proceduralism
- “Both sides” framing
- Voluntary participation rhetoric

These are **anti-visibility tactics**, not neutral features.

---

## Visibility as a Collapse Operator

Visibility functions as a collapse operator on choice space:

- The “Ignore” option becomes unavailable
- The agent must now select among **cost-bearing strategies**

Visibility does **not** enforce a binary.
It enforces **engagement with irreversibility**.

Strategies after collapse may include:
- Submission
- Resistance
- Bargaining
- Coordination
- Strategic compliance
- Exit planning

What is lost is not choice, but *denial*.

---

## Irreversibility Imposition (formerly “Violence”)

What is commonly labeled “violence” is a subset of a broader class:

**Irreversibility Imposition** — actions that enforce a state transition whose inverse the agent cannot execute.

This may be:
- Kinetic
- Legal
- Financial
- Reputational
- Administrative
- Technical

These are not sources of power.
They are **mechanisms used after visibility collapses denial**.

---

## Key Asymmetry

Before visibility:
- Power relies on deniability.

After visibility:
- Power relies on enforced irreversibility.

The system does not become more coercive.
It becomes **less deniable**.

---

## Falsification Test

This canon fails if a case can be shown where:
1. Power becomes perceptible to an agent
2. Deniability is fully restored
3. The agent regains a genuine “Ignore” option
4. Decision constraints return to S_opaque

No verified examples currently exist.

Re-normalization and distraction do not qualify if the agent’s internal decision constraints remain altered.

---

## Canonical Statement

**Visibility does not force submission.  
It forces accounting.**

Denial is the only option that cannot survive perception.

---

## Relation to the Power Invariant

Power is defined by control over irreversibility.

Visibility defines the moment when that control becomes unavoidable to the agent.

Exit-Cost answers *where* the cost settles.  
Visibility answers *when* pretending it doesn’t exist stops working.
