# CANON-001: Systemic Deadlock (Narrative Maintenance)

## Claim
A system has entered **Systemic Deadlock** when:

> The cost of halting the system exceeds the cost of maintaining a known falsehood.

At this point, governance no longer governs; it maintains narrative continuity.

## Characteristics
- Safety mechanisms become load‑bearing infrastructure  
- Contingency plans are retired as “unthinkable”  
- Responsibility is inverted onto operators  
- Transparency increases without increasing control  
- Reform adds complexity without restoring agency  

## Key Distinction
This is not failure by collapse.  
This is failure by **stable continuation**.

## Consequence
Once deadlock is reached:
- Internal reform is no longer viable  
- Expertise becomes paralysis  
- Criticism is reinterpreted as threat  
- The system can only be exited, not repaired  

## Diagnostic Question
> “What would happen if this system stopped for 24 hours?”

If the answer is “that cannot happen under any circumstances,”  
the system is already deadlocked.

## Status
CANONICAL
