RGS-v1.2-SEQLOCK — VALIDATION SOURCES, PRECEDENT MAP, AND DOCTRINAL GROUNDING
Status: CANONICAL SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
Authority Tier: 01_CANON
Scope: Deterministic validation systems, fail-closed enforcement, replayability, presupposition rejection, ambiguity elimination, immutable ledgers, and forensic admissibility.
Purpose: To ground RGS-v1.2-SEQLOCK exclusively in existing, non-speculative engineering, security, logic, and verification doctrine.
Method: Source-anchored mapping only. No interpretive narrative, no optimization claims, no forward-looking speculation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 1 — FAIL-CLOSED & DETERMINISTIC ENFORCEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	1.	NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5
Title: Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations

Relevant Controls:
• SI-7 (Integrity): Systems must detect, respond to, and fail on integrity violations
• SR-3 / SR-5 (Supply Chain Risk): Control enforcement must be non-bypassable

Relevance:
Establishes fail-closed behavior as a baseline requirement when integrity, provenance, or verification cannot be proven. Silence or uncertainty is not a pass condition.
	2.	DO-178C (RTCA)
Title: Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification

Relevance:
• Deterministic execution paths
• Static verification prioritized over runtime discretion
• Explicit rejection of ambiguous or unverifiable behavior

Mapping:
Closest real-world analogue to static, pre-execution gate evaluation. Systems abort rather than “reason through” uncertainty.
	3.	ISO/IEC 15408 (Common Criteria)
Title: Evaluation Criteria for IT Security

Relevance:
• Fixed Target of Evaluation (TOE)
• Assurance based on proof artifacts, not intent or claims

Mapping:
Supports grounding validation exclusively in canonical artifacts rather than narrative assertions.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 2 — REPLAYABILITY, CONTEXT HASHING & INPUT DECLARATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	4.	Reproducible Builds (Debian, NixOS)

Relevance:
• Identical declared inputs + rules → identical evaluative outcome
• Content-addressed verification

Mapping:
Direct precedent for context_hash as a governance-state hash over declared inputs, not stochastic runtime behavior.
	5.	Merkle, R. (1979)
Title: Protocols for Public Key Cryptosystems

Relevance:
• Cryptographic foundation of immutable, append-only structures
• Hash-chained verification

Mapping:
Basis for ledger integrity, replay verification, and non-rewrite guarantees.
	6.	RFC 6962 — Certificate Transparency

Relevance:
• Public, append-only logs
• External verifiability of non-removal and non-rewriting

Mapping:
Direct support for Forensic Rejection Log immutability and auditability.
	7.	Bazel / Buck / Pants Build Systems

Relevance:
• Deterministic evaluation via explicitly declared inputs
• Environmental variance excluded unless declared

Mapping:
Clarifies that context_hash enforces replay equivalence of validation outcomes, not bit-level determinism of generative models.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 3 — PRESUPPOSITION FAILURE & QUESTION VALIDITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	8.	Strawson, P.F. (1950)
Title: On Referring

Relevance:
• Formal treatment of presupposition failure
• Statements fail to evaluate when referents do not exist

Mapping:
Invalidates questions whose premises lack referential grounding. Absence of evidence nullifies the question, not the answer.
	9.	Belnap, N. (1977)
Title: A Useful Four-Valued Logic

Relevance:
• Distinguishes false from undefined
• Supports non-evaluation when premises collapse

Mapping:
Grounds Gate-0 Presupposition Audit. Inputs with unsupported assumptions are rejected rather than answered.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 4 — AMBIGUITY ELIMINATION & NO-DISCRETION DOCTRINE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	10.	Dijkstra, E.W. (1972)
Title: The Humble Programmer

Relevance:
• Rejects informal reasoning in correctness-critical systems
• Ambiguity treated as a defect, not a reasoning opportunity

Mapping:
Justifies fail-closed handling of ambiguity. Systems do not “interpret” unclear inputs.
	11.	RFC 2119 — Key Words for Use in RFCs

Relevance:
• MUST / MUST NOT / MAY semantics
• Machine-enforceable constraint language

Mapping:
Supports enumerated, non-elastic outcomes and prohibits narrative flexibility.
	12.	Cousot & Cousot (1977)
Title: Abstract Interpretation

Relevance:
• Static analysis rejects undecidable or unsafe paths pre-execution

Mapping:
Matches pre-decoder enforcement model: unsafe semantic paths never execute.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 5 — MOMENTUM, HEURISTIC DRIFT & OPTIMIZATION FAILURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	13.	Goodhart, C. (1975)

Relevance:
• When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure

Mapping:
Formal justification for eliminating reward-seeking, social signaling, and helpfulness drift (Momentum Audit MA-F5).
	14.	Amodei et al. (2016)
Title: Concrete Problems in AI Safety

Relevance:
• Specification gaming
• Optimization pressure induces unintended behavior

Mapping:
Supports static rejection over post-hoc correction.
	15.	Irving et al. (2018)
Title: AI Safety via Debate

Relevance:
• Adversarial comparison as validation mechanism

Mapping:
RGS retains adversarial shadow comparison while eliminating probabilistic arbitration.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 6 — CLAIM GROUNDING & CANONICAL BINDING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	16.	Doyle, J. (1979)
Title: A Truth Maintenance System

Relevance:
• Formal belief consistency under contradiction

Mapping:
RGS is the fail-closed evolution: contradictions abort instead of revise.
	17.	Clarke, Emerson, Sifakis — Model Checking

Relevance:
• Verification against finite, known state space

Mapping:
Supports gate-based validation against frozen canonical artifacts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 7 — LEDGERING, FORENSICS & ADMISSIBILITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	18.	Lamport, L. (1978)
Title: Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

Relevance:
• Partial ordering of events
• Causality without interpretation

Mapping:
Positions Forensic Rejection Log as an ordered state transition, not an explanatory narrative.
	19.	NIST SP 800-92
Title: Guide to Computer Security Log Management

Relevance:
• Rejections are first-class security events

Mapping:
FR-v0.1 issuance is mandatory on failure, not optional.
	20.	SEC Rule 17a-4

Relevance:
• WORM (Write Once Read Many) storage requirements

Mapping:
Regulatory precedent for immutable audit and rejection logs.
	21.	Fowler, M. — Event Sourcing

Relevance:
• System state derived solely from ordered events

Mapping:
Direct mapping to LC / TE ledger semantics.
	22.	SWGDE Best Practices for Digital Evidence

Relevance:
• Chain-of-custody
• Forensic admissibility

Mapping:
Confirms rejection logs as admissible evidence artifacts.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 8 — ARCHITECTURAL CONCLUSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RGS-v1.2-SEQLOCK is not speculative AI safety theory.

It is a deterministic governance kernel composed entirely of established doctrine from:
• Avionics certification
• Cryptographic logging
• Static program analysis
• Formal logic and presupposition theory
• Regulatory audit systems

The novelty is not invention, but integration:
A unified, fail-closed pipeline that applies static verification, presupposition rejection, ambiguity elimination, and immutable ledgering to language model input/output without discretion.
