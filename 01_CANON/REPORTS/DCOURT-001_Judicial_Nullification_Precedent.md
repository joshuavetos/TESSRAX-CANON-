1. THE ADVERSARIAL SCRIPT (TRANSCRIPT EXCERPT)

LOCATION: Superior Court of Digital Jurisdictions, Chamber 404  
MATTER: Alleged $1,200 Medical Debt (Surprise Out-of-Network Fee)

INSURER B COUNSEL:  
"Your Honor, the service was rendered. We have an internal database log showing the hospital coded the event at 3:14 AM. The defendant benefited from this procedure. To allow a ‘hardware key’ to simply delete a debt is a threat to the medical financial system."

DEFENSE COUNSEL:  
"The ‘internal log’ is a narrative. Under CANON-007, medical billing is a Service-Convergence Protocol. It requires a Patient Handshake at the point of service (T). My client’s MVH-01 kernel recorded no such handshake. Furthermore, the claim was issued at T+180 days, violating the 24-hour freshness rule."

JUDGE:  
"Counsel, that is a violation of INV-M-1 (Contemporaneous Billing). I am querying the Public Truth API for /aas/INSURER_B. Authority Score: 0.59. Status: FORCED_EXIT_PENDING."

JUDGE (VERBATIM RULING):  
"The law cannot enforce what the architecture declares NULL. The creditor failed the Freshness Gate. This is not a dispute; it is a Mechanical Impossibility. Case dismissed with prejudice. The PTL Bond of Insurer B is hereby debited $1,000 for a BYPASS_ATTEMPT_SCAR."
