# CANON-YYY — Closed World Proof (Claimant-Addressable Surfaces)

## Goal
Prove that no custodian class beyond those listed in CANON-XXX
maintains unauthenticated, claimant-level public liability artifacts.

---

## Method

For each custodian class holding third-party liabilities:

1. Identify public-facing artifacts
2. Apply authentication test
3. Verify presence of claimant-level records
4. Require at least two independent public examples
5. Reject case-level metadata without claimant lists

---

## Evaluation by Custodian Class

### Treasurers
- Public unclaimed property portals and PDFs
- Name-level records
- No authentication  
**Result: INCLUDED**

### Courts
- Bankruptcy UCFL
- County/municipal unclaimed-funds PDFs
- Name + case identifiers
- No authentication  
**Result: INCLUDED**

### Liquidators
- NCUA publishes public claimant lists
- FDIC partially publishes, bulk inconsistent  
**Result: NCUA INCLUDED / FDIC CONDITIONAL**

### Regulators
- SEC, CFTC expose case notices only
- No reusable claimant lists  
**Result: EXCLUDED**

### Trustees
- PBGC, DOL require identity verification
- Locator tools, not liability mirrors  
**Result: EXCLUDED**

### Tax Authorities
- Refund lookup requires SSN/TIN  
**Result: EXCLUDED**

---

## Conclusion

Only the following custodian classes satisfy all criteria:

- State & Local Treasurers
- Courts
- NCUA (Liquidated Credit Unions)

All others are identity-gated, case-scoped, or lack claimant artifacts.

**Closed World Status: LOCKED**
