# Closed World Proof: Claimant-Addressable Surfaces

## Goal
Prove no other custodian class beyond Treasurers, Courts, and NCUA
maintains unauthenticated, claimant-level public lists.

## Method
For each regulated custodian class:
1. Assessed public artifacts
2. Applied identity gate test
3. Validated example count >= 2 per class

## Result
Only these pass all tests:
- State/Local Treasurers
- Courts
- NCUA

All others are identity-gated or lack claimant lists.
