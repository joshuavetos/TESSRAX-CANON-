PRODUCT BOUNDARY — TESSRAX

TESSRAX provides NEGATIVE AUTHORITY only.

It determines admissibility, not correctness, quality, or remediation.

PASS does not mean approval.  
REFUSE does not imply fixability.

Any feature that converts refusal into guidance violates this boundary.

This boundary is authoritative and overrides downstream interpretation.
