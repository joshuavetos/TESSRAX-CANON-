PRODUCT BOUNDARY — TESSRAX

Version: v0.1.0  
Status: LOCKED  
Applies To: All downstream productization

--------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

This document defines the non-negotiable product boundary for TESSRAX.
It exists to preserve enforcement integrity and prevent value erosion
through feature creep, explanation, or advisory behavior.

TESSRAX is a validator, not an assistant.

--------------------------------------------------

CORE PRODUCT CLAIM

TESSRAX provides NEGATIVE AUTHORITY.

It answers one question only:

“Is it admissible to proceed?”

It does NOT answer:
- How to proceed
- Whether proceeding is optimal
- How to correct inputs
- How to achieve a PASS outcome

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT TESSRAX IS

TESSRAX is:

- A deterministic admissibility gate
- A fail-closed enforcement kernel
- A producer of violation receipts
- A machine-decidable refusal engine
- A liability-reduction primitive

Its outputs are factual, mechanical, and final.

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT TESSRAX IS NOT

TESSRAX is NOT:

- A recommender system
- A remediation engine
- A consultant
- A workflow tool
- A decision optimizer
- An AI assistant
- A compliance guide
- A “how to fix this” system

Any feature that attempts to transform refusal into guidance
violates this boundary.

--------------------------------------------------

THE “WHY THIS FAILED” RULE

TESSRAX does not explain failures beyond enumerating violations.

Violation receipts may state:
- Which invariant failed
- Which gate triggered
- Which field was missing or unsafe

They must NOT:
- Suggest corrective action
- Rank fixes
- Offer remediation steps
- Predict how to achieve PASS

Silence after violation is intentional.

--------------------------------------------------

PASS DOES NOT MEAN APPROVAL

A PASS verdict means:

- Inputs satisfy declared invariants
- No known exclusion conditions were triggered
- Temporal freshness is within bounds

PASS does NOT mean:
- Truth
- Legality
- Correctness
- Endorsement
- Authorization
- Immunity from risk

TESSRAX certifies admissibility, not merit.

--------------------------------------------------

LIABILITY BOUNDARY

TESSRAX assumes no downstream liability.

It does not:
- Execute actions
- File claims
- Submit documents
- Notify parties
- Trigger workflows

All liability remains with the invoking system or operator.

--------------------------------------------------

EXTENSION RULE

Product extensions are permitted ONLY if they:

- Preserve statelessness
- Preserve fail-closed semantics
- Preserve silence on remediation
- Preserve versioned enforcement
- Preserve diagnostic-first outputs

Extensions that add discretion, guidance, or optimization
are prohibited.

--------------------------------------------------

AUTHORITY

This boundary is authoritative.

If any product feature conflicts with this document:
- The feature is invalid
- The boundary governs
- The feature must be removed or refused

--------------------------------------------------

END PRODUCT BOUNDARY
