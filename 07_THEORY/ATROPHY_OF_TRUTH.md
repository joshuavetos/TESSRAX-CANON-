# The Atrophy of Truth

## Claim
Truth decays when humans no longer practice reconstructing it.

Automation does not just remove labor.
It removes epistemology.

## Mechanism
- Systems act
- Humans explain after the fact
- Explanations replace verification

## Result
Humans become narrative front-ends for machine state.

## Biological Layer
This is not only institutional.
Memory atrophies without friction.

## Conclusion
Sovereign inertia is not a policy failure.
It is a cognitive one.
