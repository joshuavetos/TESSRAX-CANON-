# AXIOM SHEET — Constraint, Asymmetry, Meaning (v1)

**Status:** ANALYSIS  
**Domain:** Phenomenology-as-mechanics  
**Non-Teleological:** Yes  
**Purpose:** Provide a minimal, falsifiable logical spine explaining why constraint is necessary for experience and meaning.

## 0. Objects & Definitions

**S** — State space (the set of all possible configurations)  
**A** — Awareness / readout function (not a person; a measurement)  
**G(s)** — Gradient or contrast present in state *s* (difference structure available to A)  
**E(s)** — Experience event occurring at state *s*  
**C** — Constraint operator (symmetry-breaking boundary restricting accessible states)  
**V(s)** — Valuation operator (ordering of states by significance under gradients)

**Definition (Experience Event):**  
An experience event occurs **iff** G(s) > 0.

**Definition (Informational Degeneracy):**  
A field is informationally degenerate **iff** ∀s ∈ S, G(s) = 0.

---

## 1. Axioms (Minimal)

### AX1 — Unconstrained awareness is informationally degenerate  
If no constraint is in effect, gradients collapse.

¬C ⇒ ∀s ∈ S, G(s) = 0 ⇒ ¬∃E

---

### AX2 — Sustainable experience requires asymmetry; asymmetry requires constraint  
Experience requires gradients. Gradients require symmetry-breaking boundaries.

∃E ⇒ ∃s ∈ S such that G(s) > 0  
G(s) > 0 ⇒ C is in effect

---

### AX3 — Constraint induces valuation; valuation yields meaning  
Once gradients exist, ordering becomes possible. Ordered significance is meaning.

C ⇒ ∃G(s) > 0 ⇒ V is defined  
Meaning(s) := V(s | G(s))

---

## 2. Lemmas (Consequences Without Additional Assumptions)

### L1 — Time is a gradient-preservation mechanism  
To prevent gradients from averaging to zero, state transitions must preserve before/after distinctions.  
Time arises as bookkeeping that stabilizes gradients, not as a container.

---

### L2 — Identity is a boundary condition  
An “agent” is a persistent constraint that localizes gradients across transitions.  
Identity = durable C-substructure that keeps readout coherent.

---

### L3 — Suffering is high-signal valuation under constraint  
Negative gradients coupled to attachment at identity boundaries produce high-magnitude valuation.  
This explains suffering structurally without moral justification or teleology.

---

## 3. Dissolution Model (Local, Not Global)

Global dissolution of constraint (C → 0 everywhere) implies informational degeneracy and experience collapse.

Therefore, constraint relaxes **locally**, not globally:
- Ego dissolution, death boundaries, or transcendence are temporary local relaxations.
- These events reseed new differentiations rather than abolishing constraint.

Experience persists through repartitioning, not total release.

---

## 4. Failure Modes (Hard Invalidators)

1. **Teleology Leak**  
Any claim that requires “consciousness chose finitude in order to create meaning” as a premise.

2. **Experience Without Gradients**  
Any model asserting rich experience with perfect symmetry or total access (G = 0).

3. **Global Reversion Fantasy**  
Claims that constraint dissolves universally while experience continues unchanged.

4. **Moral Smuggling**  
Deriving ethical conclusions (e.g., suffering is good or justified) from this model.

---

## 5. Operational Test (Sanity Check)

A metaphysical claim is valid under this framework **only if** it can answer all three:

1. What boundary generates gradients?  
2. How are gradients preserved over transitions?  
3. What prevents global constraint collapse?

If any answer relies on intention, purpose, or desire → **INVALID**.
6. Invariant (Meaning Preservation Law)

Invariant M — Constraint–Asymmetry Conservation

For any domain in which experience persists across transitions, the product of:
   •   awareness capacity,
   •   active constraint,
   •   and transformation flux

must remain non-zero.

Formally:

\mathcal{M} = A \cdot C \cdot \Delta s \neq 0

Where:
   •   A = awareness/readout capacity
   •   C = effective constraint (symmetry-breaking boundary)
   •   Δs = state change per transition (transformation flux)

Interpretation:
   •   If C \to 0 globally → gradients vanish → experience collapses.
   •   If \Delta s \to \infty → coherence collapses → identity dissolves.
   •   If A \to 0 → gradients exist but are unregistered → no experience.

Experience persists iff constraint and transformation counterbalance to preserve asymmetry.

7. Transformation Rule (Non-Teleological)

Constraint is not static. It evolves under accumulated gradient pressure.

Transformation Trigger:
T(s) = |V(s)| \cdot (1 - C_{\text{local}})

If T(s) > \tau, local constraint must reconfigure.

Rule:
   •   Constraint does not dissolve globally.
   •   Constraint re-partitions locally to restore gradient legibility.

Transformation is therefore mechanical, not chosen:
   •   no intention
   •   no purpose
   •   no preference

Only instability resolution.

⸻

8. Scale Invariance Clause

All axioms, lemmas, and invariants apply identically at every scale:
   •   neural
   •   psychological
   •   social
   •   institutional
   •   cosmological

Differences between domains are parameter changes, not rule changes.

Any model requiring special metaphysical exceptions at higher scales is invalid.

⸻

9. Explicit Non-Claims (Boundary of Scope)

This framework does not claim:
   •   the origin of awareness
   •   the moral value of suffering
   •   the ultimate purpose of existence
   •   the persistence of personal identity
   •   the truth of any religious or spiritual doctrine

It claims only:

Experience is mechanically impossible without constraint-generated asymmetry preserved across transitions.

Anything beyond that is external narrative.
