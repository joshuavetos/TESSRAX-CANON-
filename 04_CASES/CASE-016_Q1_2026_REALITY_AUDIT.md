# CASE-016 — Q1 2026 Reality Audit (Proof of Allocation)

**Status:** EXECUTED  
**Date:** January–February 2026  
**Domain:** Energy, Utilities, Insurance, Credit  
**Related Canon:** Null Identifier / Proof of Allocation

---

## 1. Purpose

This case documents a real-world application of the “Proof of Allocation” audit rule to evaluate whether publicly stated long-dated commitments are supported by near-term capital allocation disclosed in filings.

The objective was not persuasion or advocacy, but to test whether a mechanically framed audit — constrained to public disclosures — could surface a consistent structural gap across issuers and remain legible to institutional risk audiences.

---

## 2. Governing Rule Applied

**Audit Rule (Binary):**  
If the capital does not exist in filed budgets, the pledge does not exist in physical reality.

This rule treats capital allocation as the binding constraint on physical outcomes within underwriting, credit, and valuation horizons.

---

## 3. Methodology

The audit was conducted using only publicly available materials:

- SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q)
- Investor capital expenditure guidance
- Utility rate-case and commission disclosures
- Public storm and restoration cost reporting

Constraints:
- No estimates beyond disclosed figures
- No assumptions about intent
- No extrapolation outside stated planning horizons
- No non-public information

---

## 4. Case Selection

Three issuers were selected to test the rule across distinct but related risk surfaces:

- **ExxonMobil** — upstream energy producer with long-dated transition pledges
- **Southern Company** — regulated utility facing rapid load growth
- **Duke Energy** — regulated utility with repeated extreme-weather exposure

These cases were chosen to represent different mechanisms by which long-term commitments coexist with near-term capital deployment.

---

## 5. Findings (High-Level)

Across all three cases, a consistent pattern was observed:

- Long-dated commitments (e.g., “Net Zero 2050,” “Resilience”) extend beyond the fiscal horizon in which capital is allocated.
- Near-term CAPEX remains oriented toward production continuity, load-driven expansion, or post-event restoration.
- The gap between vision horizon and fiscal horizon persists without violating disclosure requirements.

This gap is referred to as the **Null Identifier**: a long-dated target that carries narrative legitimacy without binding near-term capital obligation.

---

## 6. Artifact Produced

The audit resulted in a standalone research artifact:

**Title:**  
*The Q1 2026 Reality Audit — Proof of Allocation vs. The Null Identifier*

The document includes:
- A formal definition of the Null Identifier
- A visual representation of the Horizon Gap
- Three mechanically framed case studies
- Explicit scope and disclaimers

---

## 7. Deployment

The artifact was distributed directly to institutional intake channels associated with:
- Insurance underwriting
- Reinsurance research
- Event-driven and activist capital

Distribution was staggered to avoid coordinated-campaign signaling and to preserve independent triage.

No follow-ups were sent.  
No public amplification was conducted during the initial window.

---

## 8. Outcome Status

At the time of this record:
- No responses are required for validation
- Silence is an acceptable and expected state
- The primary success criterion is placement into institutional memory, not engagement

---

## 9. Significance

This case validates that:
- Proof of Allocation is a viable audit primitive in live conditions
- The Null Identifier can be demonstrated without speculative claims
- Mechanically framed analysis can cross domains (energy → insurance → credit) without loss of legibility

This case does not assert market outcomes.  
It records a completed application of method.
