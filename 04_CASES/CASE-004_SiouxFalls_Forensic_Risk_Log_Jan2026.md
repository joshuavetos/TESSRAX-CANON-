# SIOUX FALLS FORENSIC RISK LOG (JAN 2026)

These vectors are derived from current primary-source documents (2023–2026) and are intended to capture **forensic risk fractures** where stated public-risk posture depends on funding or risk-transfer mechanisms that are absent, contradicted, or structurally unsupported in financial reality.

This log is **non-prescriptive**: it makes no recommendations and assigns no intent. It records document-to-document dependency fractures that remain legible under adversarial review.

---

## Forensic Claim

These vectors confirm a **Resilience–Funding Disconnect**:

- Hazard mitigation posture relies on federal grants and/or risk-transfer mechanisms,
- while capital and audit documents either omit those mechanisms or explicitly negate them,
- leaving the residual risk and funding burden on the City’s balance sheet and/or user-fee base.

## Vectors

| VECTOR_ID | RISK_DOCUMENT | PUBLIC_CLAIM_DOCUMENT | ASSUMPTION | ACTUARIAL_REALITY | FRACTURE_NOTE | STATUS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RF-01 | 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (City Finance, Apr 2024) — Note 7, p. 84 | South Dakota Public Assurance Alliance Annual Report 2023 (SDPAA, 2024) — p. 2 | “SDPAA… providing liability and property coverage… ensuring risk reduction” (SDPAA claims Risk Transfer) | “These funds… do not constitute a transfer of risk from the City” (City Audit claims Risk Retention) | **Sovereign Solvency Fracture:** Pool coverage is publicly represented as risk transfer, while the City’s audit language indicates retained risk exposure persists on the City’s side. | PASS |
| RF-02 | 2024 Annual Progress Report—Hazard Mitigation Plan (City Planning, Dec 2024) — p. 2 | 2025–2029 Capital Program (City Finance, Jan 2026) — Funding Strategy, p. 6 | “Structure & Infrastructure – Stormwater drainage projects… Funding: BRIC, HMGP, City Funding” (HMP relies on Federal Grants) | “Storm Drainage Fees: $47,577,000” (CIP lists 0% Federal Grant revenue for Storm Drainage) | **Grant Dependency Fracture:** Mitigation strategy cites federal grant funding (BRIC/HMGP) as a funding source, while the capital program budgets storm drainage funding as user-fee based with no federal grant revenue recognized. | PASS |
| RF-03 | 2025–2029 Capital Program (City Finance, Jan 2026) — Revenue Assumptions, p. 6 | 2025–2029 Capital Program (City Finance, Jan 2026) — Expenditures, p. 4 | “Revenue assumptions… 2024–2026 = 4.0 percent growth” (Sales Tax) | “The program prioritizes the replacement, rehabilitation…” (Maintenance focus, not Expansion) | **Growth–Maintenance Fracture:** Revenue model assumes sustained growth, while the capital program’s dominant allocations are oriented toward maintenance/rehabilitation rather than growth-enabling expansion capacity. | PASS |

## Forensic Note for Triage (Non-binding)

- **RF-01 (Insurance Mirage)** is the highest-leverage vector: an audit-language contradiction against a risk-transfer surface.
- **RF-02 (Grant Phantom)** is the most operational resilience lever: a funding-source dependency mismatch between hazard mitigation posture and budget reality.
- **RF-03 (Growth vs Maintenance)** is supportive: use to reinforce systemic disconnect, not as the primary spear.

---

## Scope Notes

- This artifact is limited to **document-to-document** dependency fractures and **does not** assert wrongdoing.
- Any future use should attach or link the underlying primary documents and preserve retrieval metadata (date/time/URL) to maintain reconstructability.
