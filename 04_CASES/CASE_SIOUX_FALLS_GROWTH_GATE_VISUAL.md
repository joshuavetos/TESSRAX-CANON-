Title: Sioux Falls Growth-Gate: Securing Our Future Without Tax Hikes

Description:
A three-panel infographic explaining the “Growth-Gate” mechanism for Sioux Falls.

Left panel (“Current Path – Unfunded Sprawl”):  
- A winding road labeled “Tier 2/3 Growth (Outer)” leads toward a cliff labeled “2035 Fiscal Cliff & Tax Spikes.”  
- A distressed taxpayer figure is shown falling near the cliff with “Taxpayer Burden” at the bottom.  
- A large red X reinforces that this is the undesirable path.

Center panel (“The Growth-Gate Mechanism (MGGO)”):  
- A vertical traffic light dominates the panel, with the top (red) section labeled “Tier 2/3: STOP (Unfunded)” and the bottom (green) labeled “Tier 1 (e.g., Veterans Pkwy): GO (Funded).”  
- Next to the light is an “Infrastructure Fund” icon (a locked vault).  
- Arrows show that when Tier 2/3 funding is below 80%, the gate is closed and “No Permits” are issued.  
- A “Funding Meter” is filled from a “Developer Pre-Pay (‘Take-or-Pay’ Contract)” icon (construction worker with money), and when the meter reaches 80%+, the gate opens to green.

Right panel (“The Result – Growth Pays Growth”):  
- A stable, elevated roadway leads into a small, well-serviced neighborhood, labeled “Sustainable Development.”  
- A shield icon labeled “CIP Protected” sits in the foreground.  
- Three checkmarks emphasize: “CIP PROTECTED,” “NO NEW TAXES,” and “GUARANTEED INFRASTRUCTURE.”

A small note indicates this is a concept visualization of the MGGO-v1 proposal for public understanding.
