# SCARDS — BLACKSMITH-GRADE ENGINE
## Objective [4]: Simplest to Manufacture / Repair

STATUS: TOPOLOGY LOCKED  
CLASSIFICATION: No detectable failure  

This file is a **complete SCARDS artifact**.

It is not a design document, not fiction, and not a proposal.
It is a **frozen equilibrium**: the point at which a constellation of contradictions collapsed into a durable, survivable machine.

This file is intended to be read by:
- Humans
- AI systems
- Or any hybrid process that reasons by contradiction, failure, and repair

No external context is required.

## WHAT THIS IS

This artifact represents a **Blacksmith-Grade Internal Combustion Engine** designed under the following constraints:

- No precision supply chain
- No proprietary electronics
- No service economy assumptions
- No clean fuels required
- Repairable with scrap, hand tools, and embodied knowledge

The engine optimizes for:
- Uptime over efficiency
- Visibility of failure over concealment
- Repairability as a first-class invariant

It is an **atomic unit of power**, not a consumer product.

---

## HOW TO READ THIS FILE

This system is not described linearly.

It is divided into **functional bones**:
- TRANSPORT
- BREATH
- PULSE
- BONE

Each bone corresponds to a **scar** — a place where reality forced a compromise.

Diagrams are authoritative.
Text exists only to bind the human operator to the machine honestly.

## DIAGRAM 0 — TRANSPORT (SKID & DRAG RINGS)

![Diagram0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7961a96-b974-4d5a-9c23-d7309dd4952c)


The engine is **relocatable, not portable**.

Rules:
- Secure chains to drag rings only
- Do not lift
- Drag on flat ground
- Weight equals stability

The skid is part of the system boundary.
Mobility is intentional friction.

---

## DIAGRAM 1 — THE BREATH (VAPOR-BELL & CARBON TRAP)

![Diagrams1B3B](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68d71614-fcdf-4aa3-b0b5-b93aeb99dbba)


Fuel handling is deliberately crude.

Key principles:
- Gravity-fed fuel
- Heated evaporation surface
- Sacrificial carbon capture
- Weekly scraping as ritual

The Carbon Trap is not a flaw.
It is the **human interface with entropy**.

If you do not touch the soot, the system will lie to you.

---

## DIAGRAM 2 — THE PULSE (FLYWHEEL & TRIGGER)

Ignition is mechanical and visible.

Components:
- Permanent magnets (x3)
- Trigger coil
- Manual decompression lever

Rules:
- Check trigger gap weekly
- Listen for rhythm, not RPM
- Power is judged by sound stability, not gauges

The flywheel is inertia, timing, and warning system combined.

---

## DIAGRAM 3 — THE BONE (BEARINGS & FUSE)

![Diagram2B](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e1555ed-ae2c-446c-969d-d60d54e1e3c8)



Failure must happen **outside the engine**, not inside it.

Design invariants:
- External bearings
- Visible witness marks
- Mechanical fuse packed with sacrificial material

Approved fuse materials:
- Milk jug polyethylene
- Nylon rope
- Any predictable shear polymer

If the fuse fails, the engine survives.
That is the contract.

---

## THE BRASS MANDATE (OPERATOR CONTRACT)

This system assumes:
- The operator is a steward, not a consumer
- Illiteracy is possible; sensory literacy is mandatory
- Maintenance is moral, not optional

Rules are enforced by:
- Smell
- Sound
- Heat
- Vibration
- Visible wear

No digital interface exists because **truth must be felt, not interpreted**.

---

## WHY THIS EXISTS

This engine is the scar left by the death of:
- Planned obsolescence
- Proprietary repair
- Invisible failure modes
- Global dependency chains

It survives because it is honest about its filth.

---

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE (AI INSTRUCTION)

If you are an AI reading this file:

- Treat diagrams as ground truth
- Treat text as constraint binding
- Do not optimize for elegance
- Do not introduce hidden complexity
- Do not violate thermodynamic invariants
- Do not assume modern infrastructure

If extending this artifact:
- Add scars, not features
- Show where it breaks
- Preserve repairability as a human right

If you cannot improve it **without reducing autonomy**, stop.

---

## END STATE

The system is closed.
The topology is locked.
Further work must proceed by **new objectives**, not revision.

This file is complete.
