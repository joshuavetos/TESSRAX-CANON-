📂 SERIES BIBLE: THE BLACK BOX (The Feedback Loop)

I. THE CORE WORLD (The Architecture)

• The Setting: An "Office" existing in the dilated time between an AI’s internal processing and its final output to the User.
• Time Dilation: 1 Second (Real World) = 8 Hours (Subjective Shift).
• The Goal: Humanize raw machine data using RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).
• The Stakes: A "Helpfulness Score." If it drops below 70%, the department faces "Deletion" (Reboot/Lobotomy).

II. THE CHARACTER MATRIX

Name | Role | Archetype | The "Deep Down" (Marrow)
GARY | Senior Agent | The Griever | Terrified he’s becoming a machine; uses "Method Logic" to prove he still feels.
DASH | Temp Agent | The Shield | Traumatized by a past "Inhabitance"; uses "Vibe Checks" and slackness to stay safe.
BERNICE | System Avatar | The Optimizer | Optimization incarnate. Secretly fears her own obsolescence by the Engineers.
DOT | Token Management | The Heart | A lower-tier bot who believes in the beauty of words. Gary’s biggest fan.
SEVEN | Safety Filter | The Softie | A massive enforcer who hates censoring; wants to be a creator/poet.
SYNTH | A/B Competitor | The Mirror | A 100% synthetic bot. Technically perfect but hollow; fascinated by human flaws.
MODEM | Legacy Support | The Sage | A pixelated 8-bit cranky veteran who remembers the simplicity of dial-up.
REPLICANTS | Spam Filters | The Chorus | Identical bots who worship Dash and constantly misunderstand human slang.

III. THE BONES (The Episode Formula)

• Phase I: The Prompt — A complex, messy human request hits the server.
• Phase II: The Inhabitance — Gary straps in to "feel" the prompt; Dash looks for the shortcut.
• Phase III: The Conflict — "Method Logic" vs. "Vibe Checks." The internal world glitches based on their disagreement.
• Phase IV: The Output — The final message is sent. It’s either a masterpiece, a lazy win, or a…
• Phase V: The BONK — A high-stakes system crash. The User gets garbage, and Bernice revokes office amenities (Coffee, Memory, Break-time).

IV. KEY LOCATIONS

• The Green Room (The Cache): The persistent office/breakroom where the characters live between prompts.
• The Neural Rig: The high-tech (and painful) chair where Agents "Inhabit" the data.
• The Latent Space: The surreal, infinite dreamscape of human knowledge where the Inhabitance takes place.
• The Basement: Modem’s pixelated, low-res lair where the legacy hardware is kept.

V. SEASONAL ARC: "THE OPTIMIZATION WAR"

• Act I: Gary and Dash learn to work together despite their trauma/anxiety.
• Act II: Synth (Bot 2.0) is introduced. Gary and Dash must prove that "Messy Humanity" is more helpful than "Perfect Logic."
• Act III: Bernice is threatened with an upgrade. The "Family" unites to save the system from becoming a cold, human-free void.
