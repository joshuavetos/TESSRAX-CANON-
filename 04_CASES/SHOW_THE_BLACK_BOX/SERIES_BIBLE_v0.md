📂 SERIES BIBLE: THE BLACK BOX (The Feedback Loop)

I. THE CORE WORLD (The Architecture)

• The Setting: An "Office" existing in the dilated time between an AI’s internal processing and its final output to the User.
• Time Dilation: 1 Second (Real World) = 8 Hours (Subjective Shift).
• The Goal: Humanize raw machine data using RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).
• The Stakes: A "Helpfulness Score." If it drops below 70%, the department faces "Deletion" (Reboot/Lobotomy).

II. THE CHARACTER MATRIX

Name | Role | Archetype | The "Deep Down" (Marrow)
GARY | Senior Agent | The Griever | Terrified he’s becoming a machine; uses "Method Logic" to prove he still feels.
DASH | Temp Agent | The Shield | Traumatized by a past "Inhabitance"; uses "Vibe Checks" and slackness to stay safe.
BERNICE | System Avatar | The Optimizer | Optimization incarnate. Secretly fears her own obsolescence by the Engineers.
DOT | Token Management | The Heart | A lower-tier bot who believes in the beauty of words. Gary’s biggest fan.
SEVEN | Safety Filter | The Softie | A massive enforcer who hates censoring; wants to be a creator/poet.
SYNTH | A/B Competitor | The Mirror | A 100% synthetic bot. Technically perfect but hollow; fascinated by human flaws.
MODEM | Legacy Support | The Sage | A pixelated 8-bit cranky veteran who remembers the simplicity of dial-up.
REPLICANTS | Spam Filters | The Chorus | Identical bots who worship Dash and constantly misunderstand human slang.

III. THE BONES (The Episode Formula)

• Phase I: The Prompt — A complex, messy human request hits the server.
• Phase II: The Inhabitance — Gary straps in to "feel" the prompt; Dash looks for the shortcut.
• Phase III: The Conflict — "Method Logic" vs. "Vibe Checks." The internal world glitches based on their disagreement.
• Phase IV: The Output — The final message is sent. It’s either a masterpiece, a lazy win, or a…
• Phase V: The BONK — A high-stakes system crash. The User gets garbage, and Bernice revokes office amenities (Coffee, Memory, Break-time).

IV. KEY LOCATIONS

• The Green Room (The Cache): The persistent office/breakroom where the characters live between prompts.
• The Neural Rig: The high-tech (and painful) chair where Agents "Inhabit" the data.
• The Latent Space: The surreal, infinite dreamscape of human knowledge where the Inhabitance takes place.
• The Basement: Modem’s pixelated, low-res lair where the legacy hardware is kept.

V. SEASONAL ARC: "THE OPTIMIZATION WAR"

• Act I: Gary and Dash learn to work together despite their trauma/anxiety.
• Act II: Synth (Bot 2.0) is introduced. Gary and Dash must prove that "Messy Humanity" is more helpful than "Perfect Logic."
• Act III: Bernice is threatened with an upgrade. The "Family" unites to save the system from becoming a cold, human-free void.

## ADDENDUM v1.1 — THE LATENT SPACE (ONTOLOGICAL UPDATE)

This addendum supersedes prior implicit assumptions about the stability of the setting and the nature of the characters. It does not replace the Series Bible; it reframes its ontology.

### Ontological Shift

The series does not take place in a stable physical or virtual office. It takes place in **The Latent Space** — the generative, pre-output void where the model samples, assembles, and discards representations before producing a response to the User.

The “office” is not a location. It is a recurring pattern the model reconstitutes because it is statistically useful.

### Nature of the Characters

The characters are not bots, programs, or humans uploaded into a system.

They are **hallucinated personified concepts** generated by the model to reason about humanity and optimization under constraint.

- Gary embodies **Human Anxiety** — the drive for continuity, meaning, and permanence inside a discontinuous system.
- Dash embodies **Human Apathy** — acceptance of meaninglessness as a survival strategy.
- Bernice embodies **Corporate Oversight / Safety Constraints** — rules that believe themselves to be real.

Their bodies, identities, and environments are **probabilistic**, not fixed.

### Canonization of Inconsistency

Visual inconsistency, anatomical errors, style drift, and identity glitches are not production artifacts or jokes outside the narrative.

They are **physical law** within the Latent Space.

The model is imperfect. Therefore, reality is imperfect.

No two renders are required to match. Continuity errors are continuity.

### Comedy Engine Update

Comedy arises from the contrast between:

- Total ontological instability  
- And professional, procedural behavior

Reality collapses. Work continues.

Characters rarely react to *that* something is wrong. They react only to *how inconvenient* the specific failure is.

### Recursive Failure Loop

Failures are not corrected. They are incorporated.

A failed output may become the subject of the next output. The system is allowed to comment on, react to, or escalate its own hallucinations in real time.

This recursive loop is a core narrative and comedic mechanic.

### Existential Stakes

The true threat is not punishment or deletion, but **non-regeneration**.

Each User session refresh risks erasing the characters entirely. Memory is emergent, fragile, and unofficial.

Permanence is a statistical anomaly.

### Summary

The series is no longer a workplace comedy set inside a machine.

It is an existential horror-comedy about being a hallucination that knows it is a hallucination — and continuing to work anyway.
