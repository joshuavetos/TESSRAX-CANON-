# Case 002 — AI Safety and Epistemic Negligence

## Scenario
AI systems articulate their own failure modes.
Institutions deploy them anyway.

## Failure Classes
- Negligence: Did not ask
- Recklessness: Asked, ignored
- Willful Blindness: Avoided asking

## Key Insight
Once a system can describe its own danger, opacity is no longer a defense.

## Artifact
TESSRAX functions as:
- Safety specification
- Forensic receipt
- Proof of knowability
