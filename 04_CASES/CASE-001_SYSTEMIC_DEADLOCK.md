# Case: Systemic Deadlock / Narrative Maintenance

## Summary
A system becomes terminal when:
- Halt cost exceeds stasis cost
- Safeguards become load-bearing
- Continuity is treated as moral necessity

## Characteristics
- Safety mechanisms cannot be triggered
- Reform attempts increase fragility
- Operators maintain narrative, not control

## Diagnostic Signal
“Under no circumstances can this system stop.”

## Outcome
Governance collapses into theater.
Truth becomes performative.
Responsibility inverts onto operators.

This state is stable.
Exit requires abandonment or external shock.
