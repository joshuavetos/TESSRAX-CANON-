# CASE-KILL-SPRINT — Fail-Closed Governance Falsification

This case documents an adversarial Kill Sprint applied to the implicit claim:

“Fail-closed governance with three-vector verification prevents institutional harm at scale.”

---

## 1. CLAIM UNDER TEST

Fail-closed governance can be safely applied to large-scale institutional systems
without inducing catastrophic liveness failure.

---

## 2. AGENTS DEPLOYED

Four adversarial agents were used:

1. Physics Agent — latency, energy, throughput
2. Economics Agent — liability, incentive, cost equilibrium
3. Human Factors Agent — emergency pressure, recovery friction
4. Failure Agent — silent degradation and plausible poisoning

---

## 3. KILL CONDITIONS IDENTIFIED

### K1 — Safety–Liveness Deadlock
Verification latency exceeds Maximum Allowable Staleness, causing perpetual halt.

### K2 — Economic Sabotage
Correct halts impose higher cost than silent degradation, incentivizing bypass.

### K3 — Emergency Override Collapse
A3_SURVIVAL pressure converts override into default execution path.

### K4 — Plausible Poisoning
Reality telemetry is internally consistent but factually false, producing forensic receipts of lies.

## 4. RESULTS

- VK-01 (domain-bounded, human-grounded): SURVIVES
- Global fail-closed governance pattern: FAILS without amendment

Failure occurs at the Physics × Economics intersection.

---

## 5. AMENDMENTS (DESIGN ONLY)

The following amendments were identified but remain DESIGN:

- Hierarchical MAS (federated freshness)
- Priority-based graceful degradation
- Multi-modal R-vector with disjoint evidence

These amendments are unproven and not promoted.

---

## 6. FINAL VERDICT

The original claim is FALSE as stated.

A weaker claim survives:

“Fail-closed governance is viable in bounded domains with static data
and human-absorbed halt costs.”

---

## 7. STATUS

This case is CLOSED.
Re-running this sprint is required before any scale claims.
